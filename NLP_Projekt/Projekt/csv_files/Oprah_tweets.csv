246,Oprah,"As I spoke to @vanjones68, Cook County Jail in Chicago reported 300+ #COVID19 cases. This is why @REFORM Alliance has gotten inmates medical supplies or had inmates released. Because if we don’t stop the spread of the virus inside it returns outside. #OprahTalks https://t.co/5WPThZ9rIM"
247,Oprah,Black people in Chicago are dying of #COVID19 at a rate of six times that of white residents. 72% of the city’s deaths are African American yet Black people only make up 30% of the population.

255,Oprah,"One of my concerns during this pandemic is wondering how we can all get through this and not let it become one of the most traumatic experiences of our lives.
