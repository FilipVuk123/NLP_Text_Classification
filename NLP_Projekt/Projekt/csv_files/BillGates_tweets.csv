I look forward to joining leaders from around the world to talk about some of the most important challenges we need to overcome to avoid a climate disaster. https://t.co/a9CXZzIg6Y
264,BillGates,Yesterday's verdict was a step in the right direction. But one court ruling alone will not bring to an end the injustice and inequity that Black people experience daily.  I hope we will continue to make real progress on this.
265,BillGates,"If “Time” wins the Oscar this year, it will be the first documentary directed by a Black woman to do so. Garrett Bradley’s talent makes her worthy of that milestone. This is one of the most intimate movies I have ever seen. #itsTIME https://t.co/37x1gfWZgZ"
266,BillGates,Communities of color have been hit hard by COVID-19. One of the reasons why parts of the medical system often fail Black and brown people is because it’s not designed with them in mind. Dr. Stephaun Wallace wants to change that. https://t.co/VIaM9385bv
267,BillGates,"To get to net-zero emissions globally by 2050, leaders from around the world must work together. It’s encouraging to see governments, business leaders, and financial institutions committing to a successful COP26 in Glasgow later this year. https://t.co/9bLQJvfZIR"
268,BillGates,Dr. Stephaun Wallace (@imstephaunelite) has spent the last year helping make COVID-19 vaccines work for everybody. Stephaun and his colleagues at @FredHutch are working to reach the people who are usually left behind. https://t.co/7wqSeT3DJN
269,BillGates,"The amount of cement China has consumed is a staggering statistic and reminder of how much emissions have grown in low- and middle-income countries. (Minecraft concrete doesn’t count, though server farms are responsible for a lot of emissions.) https://t.co/b8tSNNdUBy https://t.co/bFrIIUv97i"

280,BillGates,"I named my book “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” not “How to Stop Climate Change,” because our climate is already changing—and no one will be hurt more by climate change than the world’s poorest people. Here's how we can help them adapt. https://t.co/9mLJUpYErv"
281,BillGates,"Congratulations @AndrewSteerWRI on this important role. I’m excited to see what you and the Earth Fund will achieve. Avoiding a climate disaster is going to take all of us, and I’m grateful for @JeffBezos’s leadership and partnership. https://t.co/QSMBMtfUI1"

326,BillGates,This book has nothing to do with viruses or pandemics. But it is surprisingly relevant for these times. @exlarson provides a brilliant and gripping account of another era of widespread anxiety: the years 1940 and 1941. https://t.co/cm6IunxOZL
327,BillGates,"Monoclonal antibodies are one of the most promising treatments we have for COVID-19, thanks in large part to R&amp;D by Canadian scientists. Because of their generosity, people all around the world will have access to this potentially lifesaving treatment. https://t.co/2flhbV7e4n"
