2712,elonmusk,"Rapidly Reusable Rockets, R R R üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è"
2713,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut We‚Äôve already done a lot of iteration on ship. For rapid reusability, booster must return to launchpad, so inert mass impacts ascent, boostback &amp; landing burns. Triple whammy. Also, booster flight rate is ~5X that of ship, so multiple mass $ cost by 5."
2714,elonmusk,"@RenataKonkoly @Erdayastronaut First one to fly will, so Booster 4. Booster 3 will be used for ground tests. We‚Äôre changing much of design from 3 to 4. Booster 3 was very hard to build. Expect especially rapid evolution in first ~10 boosters &amp; first ~30 ships."
2715,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut Great shot! Btw, Starship Super Heavy will not have an entry burn. Delta-v is shifted more to the ship, so booster entry Q &amp; heating is lower."

2814,elonmusk,"@ajtourville Main advantage of this is a much stronger EM field compared with a rotor that is held together by metal (usually high strength steel). 

Other advantage is that rotor can go to higher RPM, as carbon sleeve (mostly) stops copper rotor from expanding due to radial acceleration."
2815,elonmusk,"@ajtourville Fiber is wound over rotor at high tension load. Machine to do this was made by Tesla Automation.

Carbon sleeve must put copper rotor in compression or it loosens at low temp due to differential thermal expansion.

3383,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut @NASASpaceflight There were baffles, but one may have acted like a straw to suck bubbles in from above liquid/gas level. 

Something similar happened on an early Falcon 1 flight, resulting in unexpectedly high liquid oxygen residuals at main engine cutoff."
3384,elonmusk,"@NASASpaceflight Fair point. If autogenous pressurization had been used, CH4 bubbles would most likely have reverted to liquid. 

Helium in header was used to prevent ullage collapse from slosh, which happened in prior flight. My fault for approving. Sounded good at the time."

3623,elonmusk,@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom has some great stories about experimenting with premixed O2/CH4 before SpaceX. That is not recommended haha.
3624,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut @TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame He became a big fan of methane, but was not pushing it initially.

3625,elonmusk,@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame That sounds correct. Tom certainly deserves a lot of credit for his excellent work on those engines! Dean Ono too for Kestrel &amp; Draco.
3626,elonmusk,"@TJ_Cooney @lrocket @SpaceX @FelixSchlang @MarcusHouseGame Tom is great &amp; was instrumental in developing early versions of Merlin &amp; Kestrel, but not later versions of Merlin or Starship/Raptor"
3627,elonmusk,"@ErcXspace @smvllstvrs T/W will be ~1.5, so it will accelerate unusually fast. High T/W is important for reusable vehicles to make more efficient use of propellant, the primary cost. For expendable rockets, throwing away stages is the primary cost, so optimization is low T/W."

4272,elonmusk,@bart_sanders Working on it. Also needs to be able fart at other cars on command.
4273,elonmusk,@SpacePadreIsle Starship is coming together!
4274,elonmusk,Price change is pushed to Thursday next week. Applies only to US for now. One week clock will start in other countries as beta is released. FSD monthly rental will also be available sometime next year.
4275,elonmusk,@austinbarnard45 There will be a 360 deg glass Star Bar (name tbd) at top of high bay
4276,elonmusk,"@DMC_Ryan Well, we have said many times that the price will rise as the product functionality improves. How much time do you think we should give?"
4277,elonmusk,@StephenKing Agreed. Are these performance tires?
4278,elonmusk,"@SpaceX Just a small-seeming issue with loss of upper stage camera. Probably nothing serious, but standing down to re-examine whole vehicle just in case."
4279,elonmusk,@flcnhvy Sure
4280,elonmusk,"Now that Tesla FSD beta is out in limited release, FSD price (new or upgrade) will go up by ~$2k on Monday"
4281,elonmusk,"@TeslaGong @PPathole @teslaownersSV @tesla_raj As soon as we complete testing &amp; regulators approve. So many different traffic signs, rules &amp; languages around world, not to mention driving on left side of road! Also, a long &amp; challenging road lies ahead getting to high 9‚Äôs reliability (way beyond human)."
4282,elonmusk,@teslaownersSV @tesla_raj Haha
4283,elonmusk,@Teslarati Dependent on proving high safety
4284,elonmusk,"@WholeMarsBlog Not intentional! We just wanted to show that you could theoretically convert the entire US vehicle fleet to electric using only the lithium in Nevada, a single state. Tesla will do lithium mining only as needed. We also found a way to extract lithium using NaCl (table salt)."

4289,elonmusk,@Erdayastronaut Got a little melty tbh :)
4290,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut Those engines could go 300 bar, but would be dicey. Pushing it for near-term tests doesn‚Äôt achieve anything, but I‚Äôm confident Raptor will do 300 bar for orbital flights."
4291,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut Raptor has now run for 90 secs at 300 bar chamber pressure before encountering issues. 210 mT-F sea level operating thrust seems achievable with no major changes. 

R-Boost variant is aiming for 300 ton thrust at 300 bar with same nozzle exit area. Will need bigger pumps."
4292,elonmusk,"FSD beta rollout happening tonight. Will be extremely slow &amp; cautious, as it should."
4293,elonmusk,Data from 3 engine Starship static fire this morning looks good. Proceeding with nosecone mate.
4294,elonmusk,@PPathole @toadmeister Yes. We also have to consider population life-months lost from lockdowns &amp; other restrictions vs life-months lost from any given disease.
4295,elonmusk,"@juanjacobs @jwangARK Firmware is probably a slightly more accurate description, but yes"
4296,elonmusk,"@PPathole @flyerandyp @mojosusan Mobi-C has too much mobility, fusion has too little. We need Mobi-D haha."
4297,elonmusk,"@flyerandyp @mojosusan Actually, it‚Äôs my neck ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/2vCoAxsrV3"
4298,elonmusk,"@flyerandyp @mojosusan Maybe I can be helpful. Had Mobi-C disc put in at C5-C6, however 1st surgery failed to remove bone spur sticking into my spinal cord. 2nd surgery took care of it. Recommend using Yelp or other online reviews of doctors. Effectiveness varies widely."
4299,elonmusk,@jwangARK Pretty accurate. It‚Äôs not so much DNA sequencing as it is using synthetic DNA/RNA to fix bugs in our code &amp; inform immune system what to attack.

4336,elonmusk,"@flcnhvy Good grief! SpaceX is getting zero money for this. Starship is designed to carry people &amp; cargo around Earth (also to moon &amp; Mars). Vast majority of use will be civilian. It‚Äôs just like an airline in space. All airlines sometimes carry military cargo, but ~99% is civilian."
4337,elonmusk,"@Teslarati With FSD, we got stuck in a lot of local maximums, which wasn‚Äôt clear until we hit the ceiling. This time, it‚Äôs right."
4338,elonmusk,"@RationalEtienne @28delayslater Thank you, much more accurate haha"
4339,elonmusk,@28delayslater This graph appears to be upside down
4340,elonmusk,"@Teslarati Sheer magnitude of the entire production system is hard to appreciate. Almost every element of production is &gt;75% automated. Only wire harnesses &amp; general assembly, which are &lt;10% of production costs, are primarily manual."
4341,elonmusk,@TeslaClubIN @cleantechnica Will release order configurator probably in Jan
4342,elonmusk,"@cleantechnica Limited FSD beta releasing on Tuesday next week, as promised. This will, at first, be limited to a small number of people who are expert &amp; careful drivers."
4343,elonmusk,"@shortword @jwangARK The SoC‚Äôs sync with each other 20 to 30 times/sec, exchanging output of NNs that should be in harmony, like a symphony, so it‚Äôs fairly obvious when one is discordant"
4344,elonmusk,"@jwangARK Tesla FSD computer‚Äôs dual SoCs function like twin engines on planes ‚Äî they each run different neural nets, so we do get full use of 144 TOPS, but there are enough nets running on each to allow the car to drive to safety if one SoC (or engine in this analogy) fails."
4345,elonmusk,"@jwangARK Accurate analysis. Quite a few

4353,elonmusk,@flcnhvy Definitely
4354,elonmusk,"@enn_nafnlaus Exactly. He plays the ‚Äúpoor inventor‚Äù card, but was rich all along &amp; invented nothing (as far as I know). I went down to zero cash or sellable assets in 2008/2009, had no house &amp; had to borrow money from friends to pay rent."
4355,elonmusk,"@enn_nafnlaus There are sketchy edits to Tesla wiki that whitewash Eberhard‚Äôs problems/glorify his role. Pretty odd. I was interim CEO/co-CEO from July 2007. Michael Marks was co-CEO for ~Q4 2007 &amp; Ze‚Äôev Drori for Q1 to ~Q3 2008. After Q3 2008 financing round bust, no choice but to be CEO."
4356,elonmusk,"@enn_nafnlaus When Eberhard was fired from the Tesla CEO role in mid 2007 for providing false information to me &amp; the board, no one left with him. That says it all."

4405,elonmusk,@skorusARK Marginal cost of Starship mass to orbit should be well under $100/kg. Fully burdened cost depends on flight rate.
4406,elonmusk,"@WholeMarsBlog Prototypes are a piece of cake, but high volume production of a new technology is extremely hard. Takes much longer than people think to climb the production S-curve. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough that production is by *far* the hard part."

4418,elonmusk,@flcnhvy @alvianchoiri We‚Äôre not seeing notable differences yet. I think the boosters could probably do 100+ reflights. Some of the (small) composite helium tanks would need to be replaced. Maybe turbopump hot sections.

5417,elonmusk,"@Mad_Maelstrom @Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Throttling is done by adjusting flow to the ox and fuel preburners.

5418,elonmusk,"@SciGuySpace Tank didn‚Äôt burst, but leaked at 7.6 bar. This is a good result &amp; supports idea of 304L stainless being better than 301. We‚Äôre developing our own alloy to take this even further. Leak before burst is highly desirable."
5419,elonmusk,"@Peter_J_Beck @torybruno @Starlinksat223 @Erdayastronaut Yeah. Merlin, using a single pintle injector with cold, liquid propellant, needs a longer chamber than Raptor, which uses a large number of coaxial injectors, despite Merlin being less than half thrust. Propellant enters Raptor chamber as hot gas that‚Äôs already mixed."

6203,elonmusk,@PPathole @flcnhvy @Tesla Yes. Is there more? Should be a lot of data by now.
6204,elonmusk,@flcnhvy @Tesla Making good progress. We will do whatever is needed to help in these difficult times.

6418,elonmusk,"@JohnHanzl Sorry, meant to say LOX header tank in tip of nose. CH4 main tank is above LOX main."
6419,elonmusk,@SciGuySpace These problems are fundamentally intertwined. Building many rockets allows for successive approximation. Progress in any given technology is simply # of iterations * progress between iterations.
6420,elonmusk,@SciGuySpace Hardest problem by far is building the production system of something this big. 2nd hardest is achieving full &amp; rapid reuse with payload to orbit of ~2%.

6696,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut @BocaChicaGal @NASASpaceflight Everything is compressible, but liquid compression at these pressures is not significant.

7048,elonmusk,"@SciGuySpace @yokem55 @waynehale Without a fully &amp; rapidly reusable orbital rocket, humanity will never be a multiplanet species"
7049,elonmusk,@lexfridman Bad logic is always ugly
7050,elonmusk,@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Deleting throttle allows the engine to achieve max thrust on max thrust variant. Other variants will have throttle.
7051,elonmusk,"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy SpaceX engine production is gearing up to build about a Raptor a day by next year, so up to 365 engines per year. Most will be the (as high as) 300 ton thrust (but no throttle &amp; no gimbal) variant for Super Heavy. Cumulative thrust/year could thus be as high as 100,000 tons/year."
7052,elonmusk,"@bluemoondance74 @flcnhvy Raptor is evolving rapidly. Probably wouldn‚Äôt consider it to be even V1.0 until roughly engine 50, although probably engines 12+ can be retrofitted for orbital flight, especially on Super Heavy, which is less sensitive to engine variation. It just needs crazy up force!"
7053,elonmusk,@jchybow @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Pretty much
7054,elonmusk,"@leo_cadle @teslaownersSV @flcnhvy Exactly! It‚Äôs also a far more exciting &amp; inspiring future if consciousness is out there among the stars, than forever confined to Earth until some eventual extinction event, however far in the future that may be (hopefully, very far)."
7055,elonmusk,"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy No, in the beginning, assuming you even make it there alive, Mars will be far more dangerous &amp; difficult than Earth &amp; take decades of hard labor to make self-sufficient. That‚Äôs the sales pitch. Want to go?"
7056,elonmusk,"@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy So it will take about 20 years to transfer a million tons to Mars Base Alpha, which is hopefully enough to make it sustainable"
7057,elonmusk,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy As the planets align only once every two years
7058,elonmusk,@teslaownersSV @flcnhvy A thousand ships will be needed to create a sustainable Mars city
7059,elonmusk,@Malcolmmarsman @flcnhvy No problem. We could program Starship to perform Swan Lake in the sky. Minimizing landing burn propellant mass is what‚Äôs hard.
7060,elonmusk,"@flcnhvy Current global payload to orbit capacity is about 500 tons per year, of which Falcon is about half"
7061,elonmusk,"@flcnhvy If we build as many Starships as Falcons, so ~100 vehicles &amp; each does 100 tons to orbit, that‚Äôs a capacity of 10 million tons of payload to orbit per year"
7062,elonmusk,"@flcnhvy Payload to orbit per year of Starship fleet is most mind-blowing metric, as it‚Äôs designed to fly 3X per day, which is ~1000X per year"
7063,elonmusk,@flcnhvy The economics have to be something like that to build a self-sustaining city on Mars

7078,elonmusk,"@TJ_Cooney That said, most Starship spaceports will probably need to be ~20 miles / 30km offshore for acceptable noise levels, especially for frequent daily flights, as would occur for point to point flights on Earth"
7079,elonmusk,"@TJ_Cooney Wow, 2011 seems like eons ago! With fairing recovery, Falcon is ~80% reusable, but reflight takes several days &amp; requires boats. Starship will be fully reusable with booster reflight possible every few hours &amp; ship reflight every 8 hours. No boats needed."

7459,elonmusk,"@Kristennetten @Model3Owners The fundamental operating principle is that prices, while they may change, will change for all equally &amp; should never be a function of bargaining. This is normal for most products, but weirdly not for the auto industry in most parts of the world."

7462,elonmusk,"@Teslatunity @Model3Owners There aren‚Äôt really meant to be ‚ÄúTesla incentives‚Äù, just general price changes to reflect optimal value of product, as we sometimes get prices of some variants wrong or need to (partially) address shifts in tax incentives.

7508,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut @DJSnM @KevinKling12 @spaceXcentric Distance from fireball is 0.5*a*t^2, so if t is small, you haven‚Äôt moved far even if a is high.

8022,elonmusk,"@baconmashwbs @Canis_Majoris_6 @YusifzadaAgshin That would be unwise. Probably needs a restraint mechanism like Disney‚Äôs Space Mountain roller coaster. Would feel similar to Space Mountain in a lot of ways, but you‚Äôd exit on another continent."

8061,elonmusk,@Some1gee @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy It‚Äôs a factor. Main reason is that FFSC is the ultimate architecture for converting propellant into rocket velocity.
8062,elonmusk,"@Elthiryel @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Yes, they run at *much* higher pressure, but lower temperature. Thermal shock &amp; strain are what fatigue Merlin turbine blades. Solvable for high reusability, but better to apply that engineering to Raptor."
8063,elonmusk,"@SpaceXFan97 @Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Same as last time, although we made a design improvement that could yield about 7 bar more"
8064,elonmusk,@Erdayastronaut @13ericralph31 @HarryStoltz1 @flcnhvy Merlin could probably do 1000 flights too. Turbine blade fatigue cracking would require periodic weld repair or replacement. Probably some seals &amp; bearings as well. Coking not really an issue.

8202,elonmusk,@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Would love to do exactly that
8203,elonmusk,"@Cosmic_Penguin Agreed, sent a note to Starlink team last week specifically regarding albedo reduction. We‚Äôll get a better sense of value of this when satellites have raised orbits &amp; arrays are tracking to sun."
8204,elonmusk,"@fcain @varunversion1 @Erdayastronaut @SpaceX Exactly, potentially helping billions of economically disadvantaged people is the greater good. That said, we‚Äôll make sure Starlink has no material effect on discoveries in astronomy. We care a great deal about science."

9373,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut @martinengwicht @realkrauswife @Tesla The guides are basically just a wheel, a shock absorber &amp; a solenoid. Costs a few hundred dollars in volume."
9374,elonmusk,"@MattRemp Yeah, it would allow many streets to become parks and walking areas. Less concrete, more trees."
9375,elonmusk,"@martinengwicht @realkrauswife Probably only need three types: straight ramp, spiral ramp &amp; elevator. Latter only for tight spaces."
9376,elonmusk,"@ElSchumi @FredericLambert @boringcompany Passive lateral safety is required by regulators &amp; I think they‚Äôre right. Might be able to build this into the tunnel wall though. So long as the vehicle is prevented by physics from rolling or jackknifing, there is probably a good safety argument."
9377,elonmusk,"@FredericLambert @boringcompany You‚Äôre right. We did have a sim ready, but it was confusing, so I didn‚Äôt include it. We‚Äôre working on one that makes things clear."
9378,elonmusk,"@realkrauswife Pop up, park and walk!"

9556,elonmusk,Fortnite irl
9557,elonmusk,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks &amp; a picture.
9558,elonmusk,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
9559,elonmusk,Not much but it is ours https://t.co/gx2l84M3f7
9560,elonmusk,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks &amp; we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent https://t.co/VChOVXXVaz
9561,elonmusk,"@TechDeals_16 We have to truck to departure rail head &amp; truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too &amp; trains don‚Äôt leave often."
9562,elonmusk,"@vincent13031925 Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
9563,elonmusk,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe &amp; Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
9564,elonmusk,@FredericLambert We bought some trucking companies &amp; secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
9565,elonmusk,@victorpoughon Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
9566,elonmusk,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it‚Äôs better to use trucks. Single load/unload &amp; direct to owner location."
9567,elonmusk,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30 https://t.co/npmPuSXNWC
9568,elonmusk,@InsideEVs We will fight Big Tequila!

9576,elonmusk,@_sheateher @MalibuWine Is he ok?
9577,elonmusk,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler. https://t.co/gRpj5uaS0N"
9578,elonmusk,@karaswisher Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
9579,elonmusk,"@kenlacovara Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms &amp; partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
9580,elonmusk,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for ‚Äúgrant money‚Äù. They earn ü•ú vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
9581,elonmusk,"@SeanGVarney That is true &amp; should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
9582,elonmusk,"We know we‚Äôll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel &amp; have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now &amp; avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong &amp; oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far ‚Ä¶ https://t.co/TvyuDBf3lR"
9583,elonmusk,@zandywithaz Because people on the ground know more about what‚Äôs actually needed than politicians do
9584,elonmusk,"@JackCydia Good, but not hospital grade. S &amp; X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid &amp; alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
9585,elonmusk,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S &amp; X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
9586,elonmusk,"@tizmagik @TeslaSupport Fair point, will reenable"
9587,elonmusk,"@mihk101 Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."

9592,elonmusk,"@Erdayastronaut @annerajb No, we‚Äôre building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
9593,elonmusk,@Erdayastronaut @annerajb Won‚Äôt land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield &amp; high Mach control surfaces are what we can‚Äôt test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.

We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
9629,elonmusk,"@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
9630,elonmusk,"@vincent13031925 @Teslarati @panasonic Tesla will manufacture all battery modules &amp; packs at China Giga, as we do today in California &amp; Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
9631,elonmusk,"@Teslarati Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"

9775,elonmusk,@j_brorsson @ElectrekCo @FredericLambert Somewhere between 500% &amp; 2000%
9776,elonmusk,"@ElectrekCo @FredericLambert To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU &amp; better use of discrete GPU."

9878,elonmusk,"@LanceUlanoff Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling &amp; driving feel. Extremely important metric."

10286,elonmusk,@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks &amp; front/rear rope tow hitch &amp; lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
10287,elonmusk,@bonnienorman @TeslaBull @trippedover Interesting
10288,elonmusk,"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Great, thanks"
10289,elonmusk,@JamesWorldSpace Inflatable tubes &amp; pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand &amp; is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
10290,elonmusk,"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out &amp; water won‚Äôt come in"
10291,elonmusk,"@thanr @JamesWorldSpace Does you know output voltage &amp; amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
10292,elonmusk,@JamesWorldSpace SpaceX &amp; Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
10293,elonmusk,"@JamesWorldSpace Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd &amp; 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps &amp; tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up &amp; then transit."
10294,elonmusk,"@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
10295,elonmusk,@chiefpad @JamesWorldSpace Have a small velcro slit entrance &amp; exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
10296,elonmusk,"@ladykayaker @JamesWorldSpace Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
10297,elonmusk,@JamesWorldSpace Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network &amp; inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof &amp; auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.

10889,elonmusk,"@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
10890,elonmusk,@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues &amp; give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW &amp; everybody already gets healthcare.
10891,elonmusk,"@dmatkins137 @ShayneRarma @NASA Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines &amp; tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal."

10895,elonmusk,@trace_remick @clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo It can tow far more than rated capacity
10896,elonmusk,@clprenz @ivanovi_ivaylo Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
10897,elonmusk,"@ivanovi_ivaylo With production, 1st you need achieve target rate &amp; then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money &amp; die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla &amp; live."
10898,elonmusk,@willardslammo @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
10899,elonmusk,@MacTechGenius @marshall5912 @buckycovington Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun &amp; shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
10900,elonmusk,"@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union."
10901,elonmusk,"@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried &amp; hourly, union &amp; non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally &amp; on social media &amp; lied about it."
10902,elonmusk,@KingLutron @marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius Exactly
10903,elonmusk,@marshall5912 @buckycovington @MacTechGenius They can form a union whenever they want &amp; there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.
10904,elonmusk,@paulmacguyscott Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It‚Äôs like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
10905,elonmusk,"@Josh_Soto They are correct. It‚Äôs awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
10906,elonmusk,"@JimmyRussellExe It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can‚Äôt tell"
10907,elonmusk,@AntVenom @zacharyj98 Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
10908,elonmusk,"@Josh_Soto Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
10909,elonmusk,@zacharyj98 Good idea ...
10910,elonmusk,@MacTechGenius That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
10911,elonmusk,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front &amp; a motor in rear. One is optimized for power &amp; one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination &amp; don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
10912,elonmusk,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec &amp; top speed to 140 mph.
10913,elonmusk,@PPathole Black &amp; white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
10914,elonmusk,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
10915,elonmusk,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker &amp; with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
10916,elonmusk,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3:
3.5 sec  0-60mph 
155 mph Top Speed
310 mile Range"
10917,elonmusk,"@plot_qasc It‚Äôs only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
10918,elonmusk,@clemyeung Exactly
10919,elonmusk,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself &amp; zero paperwork.
10920,elonmusk,@Everman @scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf I‚Äôm about to test the configurator &amp; then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight

10922,elonmusk,@scottwww @KymmPuckeridge @ElementC9 @griff_golf That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
10923,elonmusk,"@DMC_Ryan Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20‚Äù Performance wheels, black &amp; white interior."
10924,elonmusk,"@DMC_Ryan AC induction front &amp; switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output &amp; get double the burn-in."

10937,elonmusk,"@andrewbg Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
10938,elonmusk,"@Kasabiii It certainly needs to be better &amp; we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives &amp; reduces injuries should be released."
10939,elonmusk,What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
10940,elonmusk,"It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage https://t.co/6gD8MzD6VU"
10941,elonmusk,"@TalkTesla @Techmeme @timkhiggins According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
10942,elonmusk,"@Techmeme @timkhiggins This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."

10948,elonmusk,Good piece by Ars https://t.co/7C3X0TjUX9
10949,elonmusk,@RitaJKing Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
10950,elonmusk,"@DylanNeumann2 @Everman Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî quaint, but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines &amp; trains in general."
10951,elonmusk,"@Everman Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."

10959,elonmusk,"@existentialcoms Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶"

11008,elonmusk,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising &amp; no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."

12141,elonmusk,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon &amp; into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ... https://t.co/mA8ZgutrbE
12142,elonmusk,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
12143,elonmusk,@erikhaaland We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
12144,elonmusk,@nickbaum I believe so
12145,elonmusk,@Mr_Ewe_Guy Oh so little faith
12146,elonmusk,@kryniog The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
12147,elonmusk,@ToddGerkens Yeah
12148,elonmusk,@HolsMichael Start taking orders in April
12149,elonmusk,"@dr_angus Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
12150,elonmusk,"@akaWrecks @ckalapala Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles ‚Ä¶"
12151,elonmusk,@CamKode The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
12152,elonmusk,"@BlueBowles If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
12153,elonmusk,@juanmlemao No problem :)
12154,elonmusk,"@DJBurges Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
12155,elonmusk,@faultywarrior @matt_trulli @FredericLambert @TimShelton @JimPengelly Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
12156,elonmusk,"@TimShelton @FredericLambert @JimPengelly First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months."
12157,elonmusk,@meangene2030 Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
12158,elonmusk,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3 https://t.co/zcs6j1YRa4
12159,elonmusk,@FredericLambert It still has one display
12160,elonmusk,@VoltzCoreAudio Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
12161,elonmusk,"@arctechinc The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
12162,elonmusk,@asimo3089 How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
12163,elonmusk,"@trabru Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
12164,elonmusk,@oakhaller I think so
12165,elonmusk,"@FredericLambert @JimPengelly No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
12166,elonmusk,@Trojan81 Tues/Wed
12167,elonmusk,@jDaz Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
12168,elonmusk,@timothymjr Tues/Wed next week
12169,elonmusk,"@Skate_a_book Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
12170,elonmusk,"@JimPengelly Yes, but not until next year"
12171,elonmusk,@AlSaibie Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
12172,elonmusk,"@theKen_Miller Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
12173,elonmusk,@Greg525 How about now?
12174,elonmusk,@varunfatehpuria Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
12175,elonmusk,@luciojr All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
12176,elonmusk,@swindeez Definitely
12177,elonmusk,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
12178,elonmusk,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range &amp; power &amp; fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
12179,elonmusk,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
12180,elonmusk,@macwalterslives Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
12181,elonmusk,"@aaronpaul_8 I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
12182,elonmusk,@nextspaceflight @inversedotcom Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
12183,elonmusk,@lennart375 @inversedotcom The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
12184,elonmusk,"@phirate Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
12185,elonmusk,@Nites I hope that didn't work

12188,elonmusk,@wouterhuijs Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
12189,elonmusk,@x17online Except that isn't actually my house ...
12190,elonmusk,"@karaswisher Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
12191,elonmusk,@karaswisher I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
12192,elonmusk,"@CapnJesus @Lurpatron @MKBHD @jakerawr 3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
12193,elonmusk,@kyleugh Good point
12194,elonmusk,@PriyancaFord I wish. It's so annoying.
12195,elonmusk,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ... https://t.co/kGpJHNgRJO"
12196,elonmusk,"@BizbuilderUSA @mcannonbrookes It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
12197,elonmusk,"@Legit_bacon @mcannonbrookes Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
12198,elonmusk,"@5AllanLeVito @mcannonbrookes @VGroysman Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
12199,elonmusk,".@mcannonbrookes Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
12200,elonmusk,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes"
12201,elonmusk,@ah_pton16 I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
12202,elonmusk,"@JMMZHerrera Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
12203,elonmusk,@williamwinters High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at https://t.co/FOjClHhYiL
12204,elonmusk,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power &amp; electronics both DC."
12205,elonmusk,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. https://t.co/7uXoUQf29f
12206,elonmusk,"@mcannonbrookes Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
12207,elonmusk,"@shails Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
12208,elonmusk,@mcannonbrookes $250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
12209,elonmusk,@mcannonbrookes Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
12210,elonmusk,@Zedd Will send you one
12211,elonmusk,@SimonaKitzu Self-hatred
12212,elonmusk,Thanks JJ!
12213,elonmusk,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it! https://t.co/ss2WmkOGyk
12214,elonmusk,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation. https://t.co/uQpI60zAV7
12215,elonmusk,"@jamesatbuzz This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever."

12217,elonmusk,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
12218,elonmusk,@MacTechGenius of course
12219,elonmusk,@DueDiamond maybe one of those too
12220,elonmusk,Roller coasters are awesome
12221,elonmusk,@johnpaulbrewer Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
12222,elonmusk,@donbarbieri @GreenCarReports Good chance it will
12223,elonmusk,@davidshepardson @BW @ATT @ToysRUs Exactly :)
12224,elonmusk,@meganmurp @ChrisFaile @BW I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
12225,elonmusk,@adrianvolts Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.

12228,elonmusk,@Xuan_Thai System was green for launch. I called it off.
12229,elonmusk,"@spacecom They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&amp;D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
12230,elonmusk,"@zperrin99 Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
12231,elonmusk,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
12232,elonmusk,"@Zybbby Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
12233,elonmusk,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
12234,elonmusk,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."

12248,elonmusk,"@Floydilicious Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"

12276,elonmusk,@clay_ellis I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
12277,elonmusk,@christesla @FredericLambert Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
12278,elonmusk,@trylks A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
12279,elonmusk,"@FredericLambert Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
12280,elonmusk,@CycleTrades @rtoro20 People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.

12303,elonmusk,@KENEMONICS You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
12304,elonmusk,@martinengwicht Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
12305,elonmusk,@paulvankeep Mostly anti-drug laws
12306,elonmusk,@zgiarrizzo Exactly
12307,elonmusk,"@TheLAAdams The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
12308,elonmusk,@humplik The remedy for that is changing the law
12309,elonmusk,"@CallumK24 Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
12310,elonmusk,@iLexomat There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.

12606,elonmusk,@Scott_Helme can't always detect babies and pets
12607,elonmusk,Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
12608,elonmusk,Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
12609,elonmusk,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
12610,elonmusk,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
12611,elonmusk,"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."

12850,elonmusk,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).

12897,elonmusk,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
12898,elonmusk,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.

12900,elonmusk,"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
12901,elonmusk,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
12902,elonmusk,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
12903,elonmusk,"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."

13059,elonmusk,@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
13060,elonmusk,@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
13061,elonmusk,@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
13062,elonmusk,"@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
13063,elonmusk,"@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
13064,elonmusk,"@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7."
13065,elonmusk,"@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
13066,elonmusk,@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.

13099,elonmusk,"If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
13100,elonmusk,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
13101,elonmusk,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."

13104,elonmusk,@Uncle_Gus probably
13105,elonmusk,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
13106,elonmusk,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating."
13107,elonmusk,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
13108,elonmusk,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."

13125,elonmusk,Launch &amp; landing can be seen on the https://t.co/bDd3GxQXMC webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
13126,elonmusk,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
13127,elonmusk,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
13128,elonmusk,Meant to reply to this article: https://t.co/JRvXcTG3el
13129,elonmusk,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
13130,elonmusk,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
13131,elonmusk,Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence ‚Ä¶
13132,elonmusk,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
13133,elonmusk,About 2 mins from static fire

13137,elonmusk,"@lukealization yes, from 70F to 20 F"
13138,elonmusk,@craigcocca It worked in Texas
13139,elonmusk,@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
13140,elonmusk,Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
