0,BarackObama,"Jacob Philadelphia was five years old when he visited the Oval Office and asked if his hair was like mine. That photo became one of our favorites – a reminder of the power of seeing yourself in your leaders.

Today, he's graduating from high school! Check out our recent reunion. https://t.co/gB39hFS3Wp"
1,BarackObama,"Inspired by these young leaders, @MBK_Alliance launched a Reimagining Policing Pledge for mayors and cities ready to take action. If you’re wondering how you can help make things a little better today, here are some ways to get involved: https://t.co/1E1MfT1sza"
2,BarackObama,"In the aftermath of his murder, a new generation of activists rose up to channel their anguish into organized action, launching a movement to raise awareness of systemic racism and the need for criminal justice and police reform."
3,BarackObama,"As we grieve the children of Uvalde today, we should take time to recognize that two years have passed since the murder of George Floyd under the knee of a police officer. His killing stays with us all to this day, especially those who loved him."
4,BarackObama,"May God bless the memory of the victims, and in the words of Scripture, heal the brokenhearted and bind up their wounds."
5,BarackObama,"It’s long past time for action, any kind of action. And it’s another tragedy—a quieter but no less tragic one—for families to wait another day."
6,BarackObama,"We’re also angry for them. Nearly ten years after Sandy Hook—and ten days after Buffalo—our country is paralyzed, not by fear, but by a gun lobby and a political party that have shown no willingness to act in any way that might help prevent these tragedies."
7,BarackObama,"Michelle and I grieve with the families in Uvalde, who are experiencing pain no one should have to bear."
8,BarackObama,"Across the country, parents are putting their children to bed, reading stories, singing lullabies—and in the back of their minds, they’re worried about what might happen tomorrow after they drop their kids off at school, or take them to a grocery store or any other public space."
9,BarackObama,"Getting vaccinated and boosted remains one of the most important things we can do to protect ourselves and the ones we love. If you haven't already, find a shot at a vaccination location near you at https://t.co/k4jKpPT5qo."
10,BarackObama,"We've now lost one million Americans to COVID-19. It's an unfathomable loss – these folks were our parents and grandparents, our sisters and brothers. 
https://t.co/4lsGT2FgQA"
11,BarackObama,"It’s despicable, it’s dangerous — and it needs to stop.
https://t.co/0Ch2ZosMhB"
12,BarackObama,"We need to repudiate in the strongest terms the politicians and media figures who — whether for political gain or to boost ratings — have used their platforms to promote and normalize “replacement theory” and other starkly racist, anti-Semitic, and nativist conspiracy theories."
13,BarackObama,"This weekend’s shootings in Buffalo offer a tragic reminder of the price we pay for refusing to curb the easy access to guns. It should also serve as a wakeup call for all Americans of goodwill, regardless of party."
14,BarackObama,"I’m proud to announce the Voyager Scholarship with my friend @bchesky. We hope to provide young people with an interest in public service with some financial support to graduate college, exposure to travel, and the networks they need to make a difference. https://t.co/rbtrjAlgPe https://t.co/RZ7QKNMMWw"
15,BarackObama,"If you can't join a march in person today, you can still get involved. Donate to a local abortion fund. Volunteer with activists who’ve been organizing on this issue for years. And vote on or before November 8 and in every election. Take action: https://t.co/TmIMZ9GKf1"
16,BarackObama,"Across the country, Americans are standing up for abortion rights—and I’m proud of everyone making their voices heard. Join a march near you: https://t.co/b9QFN34kHI"
17,BarackObama,"I’m a Hawai’i kid, so I’ve got to congratulate the Rainbow Warriors for their back-to-back national volleyball championships! @HawaiiMensVB, you've made all of Hawai'i proud. https://t.co/UWjoDTVEVH"
18,BarackObama,"Happy Mother's Day! I hope you all let the moms and mother-figures in your life know how much they mean to you.

@MichelleObama, thank you for being a wonderful mother and role model to our daughters and to so many others around the world. https://t.co/xirbzZC1P0"
19,BarackObama,"Happy birthday to one of the greats, Willie Mays! I’ll always remember this conversation we had while on Air Force One during the first year of my presidency. I’ve always looked up to the Say Hey Kid, and I hope he’s having a great 91st birthday. https://t.co/PcVZg8Gp9i"
20,BarackObama,"I couldn't be more grateful for all the love and support I’ve received from my mother-in-law, Marian Robinson, especially during those years in the White House when she was right by our side. We look forward to honoring her with this exhibit. https://t.co/MrHs8xslMy"
21,BarackObama,Here’s my statement with Michelle on the draft Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. https://t.co/xBJJkLYGlQ

24,BarackObama,"We can learn a lot from what Europe is doing to improve social media. Their approach may not be exactly right for the U.S., but it points toward a path forward. https://t.co/BQBBw9z8wu"
25,BarackObama,"When I hear about the courage of young leaders in our @ObamaFoundation network, I can't help but feel hopeful. Read Yuliia Sachuk’s powerful story, and learn how she’s helping Ukrainians with disabilities get to safety. https://t.co/hIXHWizpic"
26,BarackObama,"Last week, I spoke with some of the young activists who have already recognized the problem that disinformation poses to our communities and are doing their part to fix it. Take a look at our conversation: https://t.co/37LIVnyAdg"
27,BarackObama,"I was at @Stanford with the @ObamaFoundation to talk about the rise of disinformation around the world and the threat it poses to democracy. We all have a role to play here, so let’s get to work. https://t.co/IO6oi5CdQs"
28,BarackObama,"Yesterday, I talked about how we should be able to agree on some basic facts – including around issues like climate change – and how companies need to be more careful about the content they promote, especially in ads. This is a good example of progress. 
https://t.co/gNCvJlLnWK"
29,BarackObama,"When it comes to climate change, time really is running out. Earth Day is a reminder that if we pledge to do our part and then follow through on those commitments, we can help preserve and protect our planet for future generations."
30,BarackObama,"It’s up to each of us to decide what we value, and to use the tools we’ve been given to advance those values. I believe we should use every tool at our disposal to secure our greatest gift – a government of, by, and for the people – for generations to come."
31,BarackObama,Solving the disinformation problem won’t cure all that ails our democracies or tears at the fabric of our world. But it can help rebuild the trust and solidarity needed to make democracy stronger.
32,BarackObama,"Each of us has to pick a side. Do we allow our democracy to wither? Or do we choose to make it better? That’s the choice we face, and it is a choice worth embracing."
33,BarackObama,"As part of this, tech platforms need to recognize that they play a unique role in how people consume information, and their decisions have an impact on every aspect of society. 

With that power comes accountability – and the need for some democratic oversight."
34,BarackObama,"The way I’m going to evaluate any proposal touching on social media and the internet is whether it strengthens or weakens the prospects for healthy, inclusive democracy. https://t.co/jmPMO28KMU"
35,BarackObama,"Disinformation is a threat to our democracy, and will continue to be unless we work together to address it. Tune in as I share some thoughts on what we can all do now. https://t.co/6R6n3MOPPR"
36,BarackObama,"I wanted to share some of what I've read that offers useful context, solutions we can learn from, and interesting perspectives. Check it out, and then tune in to the speech on Thursday at 12:15pm PT. https://t.co/gjOgVuqIwF"
37,BarackObama,"I've been reading up on this issue, sitting down with academics, researchers, industry leaders and former regulators, and listening to young leaders who are working to make progress."
38,BarackObama,"Tomorrow, I'm heading to Stanford to deliver a speech about changes in the way we create and consume information, and the very real threat it poses to democracy."
39,BarackObama,"Through the @ObamaFoundation, we’re working to empower and equip emerging leaders to tackle issues like the spread of disinformation. https://t.co/e5T9rq4JUN"
40,BarackObama,"Part of the reason it’s hard to bring about change is because we live in a media environment that elevates falsehoods as much as truths, and divides people as much as it brings them together."
41,BarackObama,"In recent years, we've seen how quickly disinformation spreads, especially on social media. This has created real challenges for our democracy."
42,BarackObama,The Asia-Pacific region plays an important role in my own story. It's also home to a generation of young people working to create a better world for us all. I'm looking forward to getting to know our newest cohort of @ObamaFoundation leaders. https://t.co/vllf9HFIub

46,BarackObama,".@PeteSouza and I have traveled the world together, and he's captured some iconic shots over the years. So we decided to reflect on some of our favorite memories at national parks.

Take a look, and make sure to check out Our Great National Parks on Netflix. https://t.co/VvWm8sJU6m"
47,BarackObama,"On the 75th anniversary of Jackie Robinson Day, we're reminded of his groundbreaking career and legacy that has paved the way for so many who would follow—including me. https://t.co/U4CHJN2WNG"
48,BarackObama,"75 years ago, Jackie Robinson competed in his first MLB game—despite facing vicious treatment and threats. Throughout his life, Jackie used his voice to stand up for racial justice and in the process, changed America for the better."
49,BarackObama,"There’s nothing I enjoy more than being with young people. And last week, I had a chance to speak with some of the bright students at Hyde Park Academy taking part in our Futures Series with the @ObamaFoundation.

Here's a look at some of the advice I shared with them: https://t.co/Ct9z6Z8LgU"
50,BarackObama,"With the release of Our Great National Parks, I thought I'd visit one. I had fun at Great Falls Park with the kids from the @BGCA_Clubs.

I hope you'll spend some time outdoors, too. Join the #WildForAll Challenge with @TheWCS at https://t.co/PTlffHC7gv. https://t.co/TtYY1FAlFZ"
51,BarackObama,"Along with @TheWCS, we’re working to encourage folks to not only experience nature, but also take action to protect our environment and wildlife for generations to come. Go to https://t.co/PTlffHC7gv to learn more."
52,BarackObama,"Our Great National Parks is out today on @Netflix, and I can't wait for you to watch it. This @HGMedia series takes a look at the legacy of preservation and conservation, as well as the ways we can protect our amazing wildlife and natural landscapes. https://t.co/jlxUrL6MDh"
53,BarackObama,"Disinformation is eroding trust in public institutions and threatening democracies around the world. We're working with our @ObamaFoundation Scholars and leaders to combat these forces, break through barriers, and meet their communities where they are. https://t.co/rQuWvZg1uU"
54,BarackObama,This is what happens when you have an administration that’s committed to progress. I’m grateful for their work and all the people who have been involved in continuing to make the Affordable Care Act everything it can be.
55,BarackObama,"Last week, the Biden-Harris administration announced they'd fix a glitch in the regulations that will lower premiums for nearly 1 million people who need it and allow 200,000 more uninsured Americans to get access to health coverage. https://t.co/0m1Bw84TWv"
56,BarackObama,"Gerda Weissmann Klein was an author, a historian, and an inspiration to so many around the world. As a Holocaust survivor, she shared her story to remind us of the power of hope and the extent of our strength. Michelle and I send our love to her family. https://t.co/B3tFf4Hz3B"
57,BarackObama,"The students I met yesterday at Hyde Park Academy in Chicago make me hopeful for the future. They’re passionate about making a difference, and I enjoyed hearing their stories and sharing a little advice with them. https://t.co/QAOW7dmxtj"
58,BarackObama,"Congratulations to Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson for her appointment to the Supreme Court. This is a great day for America, and a proud moment in our history. https://t.co/q4C9dtKAqb"
59,BarackObama,No trip to Chicago is complete without a @ChicagoBulls game – and this time I brought along some of the young people who are part of our @MBK_Alliance and @GirlsAlliance. https://t.co/LjZmleio5o
60,BarackObama,"It's going to take all of us to protect our democracy, especially young people. There is no silver bullet, but if we focus on ideas and solutions that will strengthen our democracy, rather than weaken it, we can live up to our ideals and show the world what is possible. https://t.co/6ZU2fYQyJm"
61,BarackObama,"It was great catching up with our latest class of @UChicago Obama Foundation Scholars. They’ve been working hard to improve their communities, and I’m looking forward to following their journeys. https://t.co/Yr45VNF1CS"
62,BarackObama,"Always great catching up with @POTUS. Thanks for all you’re doing to help even more Americans get access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/vDYBIxjIy9"
63,BarackObama,"It’s good to be back at the White House! Tune in as I join the @POTUS and @VP to celebrate the Affordable Care Act and talk about how they're taking action to make it better.

https://t.co/PlAKrFD6cN"
64,BarackObama,"Progress often feels slow, and victories are sometimes incomplete. But the ACA shows that if you believe that we can improve people’s lives, and if you’re willing to work through obstacles and continually improve, you can make America better."
65,BarackObama,"But the ACA was never perfect, and we always knew we would have to make it better. That’s what @POTUS has done since taking office. Today, he’s going even further – lowering premiums for nearly 1 million people and helping 200,000 more uninsured Americans get access to coverage."
66,BarackObama,"The ACA also lowered prescription drug costs for 12 million seniors, and allowed young people to stay on their parents’ plan. And it’s eliminated lifetime limits on benefits that often put people in a jam."
67,BarackObama,"Because so many people made sacrifices and some members of Congress took courageous votes, we got the ACA across the finish line. Now, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage, and 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions can’t be dropped or denied coverage."
68,BarackObama,"Passing the ACA was incredibly difficult. People who had coverage were worried about losing it, the media was skeptical, misinformation was flying around, and Republicans showed no interest in working with us. But Joe, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and I were determined."
69,BarackObama,"The Affordable Care Act is an example of why you run for office – not just to occupy a seat, but to make a difference in people’s lives.

Today I’m joining @POTUS and @VP at the White House to celebrate everything the ACA has achieved, and help make it even better."
70,BarackObama,"Congratulations to the @KUHoops team on winning the national championship. This team was fun to watch, and they earned their first title since 2008 (which was a pretty good year)."
71,BarackObama,"Congratulations to the @GamecockWBB team and coach @DawnStaley for winning the national championship. Coach Staley has built a powerhouse, and it’s great to see all their hard work pay off. https://t.co/fZOOMKRmtC"
72,BarackObama,"I heard Betty Reid Soskin is retiring at 100, and want to congratulate her for more than a decade of service as a National Park Ranger.
 
Betty, I hope you realize just how many people appreciate everything you’ve done—myself included. https://t.co/lElFYwxVMg"
73,BarackObama,"I'm proud of Titus, Ashton, Thaddeus, Jalen, McKinley and Peter for representing @MBK_Alliance at @MarchMadnessMBB.

These talented young men from Chicago are job shadowing folks putting the weekend together to learn about the magic behind the madness. https://t.co/aJtBHlIj1Z"
74,BarackObama,"Today @POTUS announced that the U.S. will be welcoming 100,000 refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.

75,BarackObama,"As the first woman to serve as America’s top diplomat, Madeleine Albright was a champion for democratic values. Michelle and I send our thoughts to the Albright family and everyone who knew and served with a truly remarkable woman. https://t.co/8jj3GYZXbB"
76,BarackObama,"The other day, I called up DonnaMarie, Steve, and Amy to hear how the Affordable Care Act changed their lives and thank them for the work they’re doing with @ProtectOurCare to protect it.

I hope you'll watch and share your own story: https://t.co/DhAQWzxCYq"
77,BarackObama,".@POTUS’s American Rescue Plan helped strengthen the Affordable Care Act by lowering costs and encouraging a record 14.5 million people to sign up for coverage in 2022. 

We'll keep working to improve the ACA until every American has access to quality, affordable health coverage."
78,BarackObama,"During the pandemic, the Affordable Care Act helped make vaccines and COVID-19 tests available for free, covered emergency hospitalizations, and prevented insurance companies from denying anyone coverage based on a pre-existing condition."
79,BarackObama,"12 years ago today, I signed the Affordable Care Act into law. I’ve always believed that health care shouldn’t be a privilege for just a fortunate few, but a right for every American. 

Today, more than 30 million Americans have health coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/DmjgC00LpP"
80,BarackObama,"It’s been a great year for college basketball, and now #MarchMadness is officially back. I’m excited for some of the young men in our @MBK_Alliance to join the action in New Orleans. Here's a look at my picks: https://t.co/LV9do4BSWB"
81,BarackObama,"And third, a reminder that in the face of brutal repression, there are ordinary Russians that are showing tremendous courage in standing up to a senseless, destructive war. https://t.co/xh1Z10vo6V"

84,BarackObama,"I just tested positive for COVID. I’ve had a scratchy throat for a couple days, but am feeling fine otherwise. Michelle and I are grateful to be vaccinated and boosted, and she has tested negative. 

It’s a reminder to get vaccinated if you haven’t already, even as cases go down."

91,BarackObama,"Richard Hunt is one of the greatest artists Chicago has ever produced, and I couldn’t be prouder that his “Book Bird” sculpture will live outside of the newest @ChiPubLib branch at the Obama Presidential Center. I hope it inspires visitors for years to come. https://t.co/dMfkwvls9P"
92,BarackObama,"It’s hard to believe it's been 10 years since Trayvon Martin was killed. Leading up to this anniversary, I reflected on what his death meant to me as president, as a Black parent, and as a Black man—as well as what it meant for our country. https://t.co/Ywt22dOGup"
93,BarackObama,"Like Justice Breyer, Judge Jackson understands that the law isn’t just about abstract theory. It’s about people’s lives. @POTUS Biden has made an excellent choice, and I look forward to seeing Judge Jackson confirmed."
94,BarackObama,"As a protégé of Justice Breyer, Judge Jackson earned a reputation for pragmatism and consensus building. It’s part of why I nominated her twice – first as a district judge, and then to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, where she earned praise from both Democrats and Republicans."
95,BarackObama,"I want to congratulate Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson on her nomination to the Supreme Court. Judge Jackson has already inspired young Black women like my daughters to set their sights higher, and her confirmation will help them believe they can be anything they want to be. https://t.co/aCwiUBFTyj"
96,BarackObama,"Last night, Russia launched a brazen attack on the people of Ukraine, in violation of international law and basic principles of human decency. Here’s my statement on what it means, and what should happen next. https://t.co/Wa0C8XGwvK"

98,BarackObama,"I want to thank everyone who has joined @AllOnTheLine in its mission to end gerrymandering. Every phone call, every testimony, every action has made a difference in the redistricting process. And while our fight for #FairMaps isn’t over, we’ve made real progress."
99,BarackObama,"And in Ohio, @AllOnTheLine held 139 training sessions—equipping thousands of Ohioans from every corner of the state with the information and tools they need to fight for fair maps. And when the pandemic hit, All On The Line took its training online. https://t.co/DVWvLslKU4"
100,BarackObama,"In North Carolina, Karla Icaza De Austin, an Army veteran from Fayetteville, urged her state legislators to demand transparency, accountability, and fairness in the redistricting process—and reminded them of their duty to follow the will of the people. https://t.co/DhUwYbVTjl"
101,BarackObama,"Since then, folks across the country have participated in the redistricting process—many for the first time. It’s a testament to the work @AllOnTheLine has done to help folks understand why fair maps matter, and make an impact in their communities."
102,BarackObama,"Three years ago, I helped @EricHolder launch @AllOnTheLine, a people-powered campaign to fight gerrymandering and advocate for fair redistricting. All On The Line is driven by the core belief that voters should choose their representatives—not the other way around."
103,BarackObama,"John Lewis knew that change could not wait for some other person or some other time. His life was a lesson in the fierce urgency of now. On his birthday, let’s honor his legacy by taking action and creating the change we hope to see in our own communities."

106,BarackObama,".@JoeBiden played a major role in getting that passed—and over our eight years in office, carbon emissions decreased by nine percent, while the U.S. economy grew by more than 10 percent."
107,BarackObama,"When I signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009, it included $90 billion for clean energy projects. At the time, it was the biggest investment in renewable energy in American history. https://t.co/C2AoEceGt8"
108,BarackObama,"Azita Raji was a great friend and cherished member of my campaign team and administration who served our country with distinction. She represented the very best of America, and we are better off because of her leadership. She will be deeply missed. https://t.co/NmUOQ84poH"

112,BarackObama,"What gave me the confidence to move forward in spite of the odds were the people I met, including those on our campaign. They didn’t do it for me. They did it because they believed in what this country could be, and that we could change it for the better. https://t.co/6AasYvhUZl"
113,BarackObama,"It’s hard to believe that 15 years have passed since I stood in front of the Old Capitol in Springfield, Illinois, and announced my candidacy for President.

115,BarackObama,"As we celebrate Black History Month, it’s important to remember that we shouldn’t treat this month as though it is somehow separate from our collective American history. Black history is American history."

122,BarackObama,"On Holocaust Remembrance Day, we honor the victims and survivors of one of the darkest periods in our history. But it’s not enough to remember — we also need to have the courage to speak out against acts of bigotry and hatred whenever we see them."
123,BarackObama,"The Biden Administration has set up a way for folks to get four at-home COVID tests for free. Go to https://t.co/ELjD6AatMb to order, or call their hotline at 1-800-232-0233. And if you need to get vaccinated or boosted, visit https://t.co/k4jKpPT5qo today."
124,BarackObama,"The road ahead will not be easy, especially when one of our two major parties is standing in the way. But I still believe we can create a brighter future together, and I look forward to watching the Biden Administration build on this progress. https://t.co/z2j8jFokcq"
125,BarackObama,"This Administration has also recommitted to the fight against climate change, and signed a crucial infrastructure law to improve roads and buildings across our country. And they're only getting started."
126,BarackObama,"Under his leadership, our economy set the record for the most jobs added in a single year. Over 200 million people are now vaccinated against COVID-19. The American Rescue Plan provided relief to families. More people can now afford healthcare."
127,BarackObama,"For eight years, I witnessed firsthand the empathy and precision @POTUS brought to our work repairing the American economy. And one year into his presidency, President Biden's administration has led a historic recovery effort."
128,BarackObama,"In his inaugural address one year ago today, @POTUS committed to “press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.” In the year since, he and the @VP have made significant progress in the face of enormous challenges. https://t.co/5YFbMnw3Pg"
129,BarackObama,"When Michelle and I launched the @ObamaFoundation, we turned to you first. We read your letters and emails, and listened to your ideas. Five years later, we’ve come a long way with your help — and we’re even more excited about what’s next. https://t.co/l4N5KMkK1o https://t.co/TtGZSEhvqK"
130,BarackObama,"Thanks to the life-saving work by scientists and our government’s top medical experts, we have COVID-19 vaccines to protect us. This is what happens when we trust science, and hardworking doctors and researchers set out to do big things. https://t.co/4F1QZC8KYe"

My love, my partner, my best friend... https://t.co/5oDMOgcsWI"
133,BarackObama,"With the King family marching today, we remember that the fight for voting rights takes perseverance. As Dr. King said, “There are no broad highways to lead us easily and inevitably to quick solutions. We must keep going.” May we honor his memory through action forged in faith. https://t.co/Qn1q4EvXN5"
134,BarackObama,"We've seen how the Affordable Care Act continues to help folks—especially in states that didn't expand Medicaid—get the peace of mind they need. But we still have more work to do to expand access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/wOFof5iBMR"
135,BarackObama,"Tomorrow, January 15th is the last day to sign up for health care until the fall at https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Make sure to get covered today. https://t.co/eDNO1yPqIZ"
136,BarackObama,"The House just passed the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. Now the Senate needs to do the same. It's the best way to protect the right to vote, end partisan gerrymandering, and restore crucial parts of the Voting Rights Act."
137,BarackObama,That’s why I fully support @POTUS’s call to modify Senate rules as necessary to make sure pending voting rights legislation gets called for a vote. And every American who cares about the survival of our most cherished institutions should support the President’s call as well.
138,BarackObama,"The filibuster has no basis in the Constitution, and in recent years, it has become a routine way for the Senate minority to block important progress on issues supported by the majority of voters. But we can’t allow it to be used to block efforts to protect our democracy."
139,BarackObama,Now is the time for the U.S. Senate to do the right thing and call a vote on crucial voting rights legislation. Future generations are counting on us to protect our democracy. I wrote out some thoughts about why this is so important. https://t.co/hjab4Ejxox
140,BarackObama,"I wanted to share some of those stories, and also hear about the work you’ve been doing to create change: https://t.co/KhjWS3bFGo"
141,BarackObama,"Five years ago during my Farewell Address, I asked you to believe in your ability to bring about change. Since then, many of you have answered the call – starting nonprofits, organizing around important issues, and running for office yourselves. https://t.co/Mz2JqQ2gPc"
142,BarackObama,"It was a great honor to pay tribute to my friend, Harry Reid. Few people have done more for Nevada and our country over the years than this driven, brilliant, sometimes irascible, deeply good man from Searchlight.

https://t.co/jTQbDUPPOm"
143,BarackObama,"Through his groundbreaking roles and singular talent, Sidney Poitier epitomized dignity and grace, revealing the power of movies to bring us closer together. He also opened doors for a generation of actors. Michelle and I send our love to his family and legion of fans. https://t.co/zkYKFSxfKA"
144,BarackObama,"One year ago, a violent attack on our Capitol made it clear just how fragile the American experiment in democracy really is. Here’s my statement on what the anniversary means, and what we need to do today. https://t.co/9rjbjPLwLH"
145,BarackObama,"I’m hopeful about 2022. This year will undoubtedly have its challenges, just like 2021 did. But we’ve made it this far—and I still believe we can build a brighter future together. Happy New Year!"
146,BarackObama,"If you're feeling discouraged about our democracy, read this article about how citizens in Michigan took politics out of the redistricting process. It’s why the work @EricHolder and the @DemRedistrict are doing to fight gerrymandering is so important. https://t.co/0Wqd633bC0"
147,BarackObama,"When Harry Reid was nearing the end, his wife Landra asked some of us to share letters that she could read to him. In lieu of a statement, here’s what I wrote to my friend: https://t.co/o6Ll6rzpAX"

150,BarackObama,"Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a mentor, a friend, and a moral compass for me and so many others. A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere. https://t.co/qiiwtw8a5B"
151,BarackObama,"Merry Christmas, everybody! This year, I got a little help spreading holiday cheer from Sunny. Wishing you all a peaceful and joyful holiday season with the ones you love. https://t.co/qPF6L5GWEW"

156,BarackObama,"I've always enjoyed listening to a wide variety of music, so it’s no surprise that I listened to a little bit of everything this year. I hope you find a new artist or song to add to your own playlist. https://t.co/g6kBzAbrZG"
157,BarackObama,"Next up are my favorite movies of the year. Each of these films tells a powerful story, and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did. https://t.co/peFGiaTvby"
158,BarackObama,"Since these are works I have actually listened to, watched, or read, I’m sure I’ve missed some worthy stuff. So if you have your own recommendations to share, I’ll add them to the stack of books and movies I hope to catch up on over the holidays!"
159,BarackObama,"Over the next few days, I'll share my annual list of favorite books, music, and movies. Art always sustains and nourishes the soul. But for me, music and storytelling felt especially urgent during this pandemic year. I'll start by sharing some of my favorite books of 2021: https://t.co/Ewo2sIc7WM"
160,BarackObama,"You heard, @POTUS – get covered today at https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. https://t.co/reu15FZgBu"
161,BarackObama,"The best way to honor them—the only way that really matters—is to fight this epidemic of gun violence and prevent even more senseless death and suffering. We can, and must, do more."
162,BarackObama,"Nine years ago was one of the darkest days of my presidency. Today we remember the children and adults who were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, and the families who have endured so much grief."
163,BarackObama,"Last week, powerful tornadoes devastated communities across the Midwest and South. Michelle and I are thinking of the families who have lost so much. If you'd like to help with the recovery, visit: https://t.co/tuFPBEHoEq"

165,BarackObama,"As Chancellor, Angela Merkel served with integrity, leading Germany and Europe through many storms. Drawing on her wise pragmatism and her unrelenting moral compass, she made hard decisions and became a role model for many. Thank you for your leadership. https://t.co/l5zjYhfXBr"

167,BarackObama,"Senator Bob Dole was a war hero, a political leader, and a statesman—with a career and demeanor harkening back to a day when members of the Greatest Generation abided by a certain code, putting country over party. Our thoughts are with Elizabeth and the Dole family."
168,BarackObama,"Michelle and I wanted to give Santa a hand passing out gifts for the holidays, so we made a stop at the @ComerChildrens Hospital. We hope you and your family have a wonderful holiday season. https://t.co/sQ5XKsSbPp"

170,BarackObama,"Michelle and I are in Chicago this week to talk to folks who are working on some of the city’s toughest challenges.

171,BarackObama,"Shots are never fun, but the kids I met at Kimball Elementary knew how important the COVID-19 vaccines are to keep our families and communities safe. Check out @ItsMadeToSave for more information about the vaccines, and make your appointment at https://t.co/k4jKpPT5qo. https://t.co/sm3YRKZRyq"
172,BarackObama,"If you got your COVID-19 vaccine before June, now is the time to get a booster shot. All adults are eligible for the booster—just go to https://t.co/k4jKpPT5qo to find a vaccine and booster location near you. https://t.co/wx4e4cshC2"
173,BarackObama,"Getting our kids fully vaccinated is the best way to protect them against COVID-19. Today, Dr. Fauci and I stopped by Kimball Elementary School to meet with families and kids getting their vaccines—and encourage more parents and kids to do the same. https://t.co/jhReaKJ7d9"
174,BarackObama,"I’m always inspired by young leaders like Rachid Ennassiri, who is helping more people in Morocco get involved in the fight against climate change.

179,BarackObama,"When it comes to climate change, we can’t afford to go backward—or even stay where we are. If we are going to act on the scale that’s required to combat this climate crisis, we all need to step up and meet this moment together. https://t.co/jyk0ZBcv0S"
180,BarackObama,"In 2011, my Administration made a pledge to prepare 100,000 new STEM teachers over the next 10 years. I couldn't be prouder to hear that @100Kin10 not only met that goal, but trained an additional 8,000 teachers who will make a difference for our kids. https://t.co/NI2J779IYS https://t.co/uLqbuRjEeF"
181,BarackObama,"The epidemic of gun violence in America has gotten worse during the pandemic. This article points to the ways in which the proliferation of guns magnifies the consequences of bias in policing, and makes reform of police practices that much harder. https://t.co/fbK38QMCkV"
182,BarackObama,The newest cohort of @ObamaFoundation Africa Leaders will help unlock the incredible promise of the continent. I'm looking forward to supporting their work and following their journeys. https://t.co/AETZhgt4YG

184,BarackObama,"This Veterans Day, I want to share Tom Voutsos's story. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, and has continued to live a life dedicated to public service. Through @LadderUpHousing, he’s helping hardworking folks buy their own home. https://t.co/wgWG9CBMf7"
185,BarackObama,"To every veteran and their family, we thank you for your service and sacrifice to our country. https://t.co/4EYWe9pRvV"
186,BarackObama,".@SpeakerPelosi and these members of Congress are making it clear that the United States is back, and will continue to lead the way on climate change. We would not have met our Paris goals without them, and now they’re working to do even more. https://t.co/Kxi4k1tRe3"
187,BarackObama,"Young people have more at stake in the fight against climate change than anyone else. I had a chance to talk with some young people who are helping lead the fight, and could not be more impressed by their courage, creativity, and persistence. They give me hope. https://t.co/muFbKl5WcF"
188,BarackObama,"If you care about climate change, @JohnDoerr's new book, Speed &amp; Scale: An Action Plan for Solving Our Climate Crisis Now, offers concrete steps that we can all take to make a difference. https://t.co/jYmFBaDDIx"
189,BarackObama,"That’s why, if we’re going to act on the scale that’s required, climate change can’t be seen as another opportunity to score political points. We need everybody. And young people in particular have an opportunity to make a real difference."
190,BarackObama,"But once again, progress is partial. Most nations have failed to be as ambitious as they need to be, and the escalation of ambition that we anticipated in Paris six years ago has not been uniformly realized."
191,BarackObama,"The good news is that countries around the world recognize this is a decisive decade if we want to avoid a climate disaster, and are setting important goals for 2030. They’ve also promised to help countries move away from fossil fuels and deal with the effects of climate change."
192,BarackObama,"I spoke at COP26 in Glasgow about what’s happened in the six years since the Paris Agreement, and how much further we still need to go to control climate change. https://t.co/an9xxwrOQC"
193,BarackObama,"We’ve done some important work since the Paris Agreement was signed six year ago, but we’re still nowhere near where we need to be on climate. Watch live from #COP26 in Glasgow as I talk about the steps we can take to combat climate change. https://t.co/fpoGbnNehm"
194,BarackObama,"Five years ago, the Paris Agreement went into effect. Paris provided an important framework in the fight against climate change, but it wasn’t enough. That’s why I’ll be speaking in Glasgow on Monday about the road ahead and what young people in particular can do to help. https://t.co/E7P3X6jtny"
195,BarackObama,"Visit https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T to find your polling location. And if you have any questions, call the voter hotline at 833-336-8683."
196,BarackObama,"Today is Election Day, and so much of what we care about is on the ballot––from access to health care to bringing our economy back from COVID-19 to combating climate change. We need everybody going out to vote. So make a plan to vote, and make your voice heard."
197,BarackObama,"Signing the Paris Agreement to fight climate change was one of my proudest moments in office. But it was always a foundation to build on. As world leaders gather for COP26, I shared some reflections on the road to Paris and the young activists who are pushing us further. https://t.co/EebSdTQ6QS"
198,BarackObama,"In a country as large and diverse as ours, progress can often feel frustrating and slow, with small victories accompanied by frequent setbacks. But once in a while, it’s still possible to take a giant leap forward. That’s what the Build Back Better framework represents. https://t.co/ouKhRRz6qP"
199,BarackObama,"Climate change isn’t a distant environmental issue—it’s already having an immediate impact on our lives, including huge national security implications as more communities come under stress.

https://t.co/wLnJgynwCs"
200,BarackObama,"When you look at the history of big social movements, they’re usually started and sustained by young people who put in the work to make it happen. As we look to COP26, I’m inspired by the young people using their voices in the fight against climate change. https://t.co/IBdciqn8ml"
201,BarackObama,It was great to be back in New Jersey! There's too much at stake in this election to sit it out. Let's keep New Jersey moving forward by re-electing @PhilMurphyNJ and Democrats up and down the ballot. Make a plan to vote early—and get everyone you know to do the same. https://t.co/7GRvXgwf4J
202,BarackObama,"Virginians delivered for me twice, and now I’m asking them to do it again by electing @TerryMcAuliffe as their next governor. Every bit of progress in Virginia is at stake in this election—and there's no time to waste. Make a plan to vote early at https://t.co/LulNbzqbqg. https://t.co/86UgQAoKBt"
203,BarackObama,Some of the most important changes often start in state legislatures. That's why I'm proud to support these candidates for the Virginia state legislature. I hope you'll join me and the @DLCC in giving them your vote. https://t.co/jt3brA4F3B
204,BarackObama,Glad I had a chance to talk with our new champs! I really am proud of this team and their work this season. https://t.co/rHwqreQMpi
205,BarackObama,"At a time when voting rights are being rolled back, the Freedom to Vote Act would strengthen our democracy and give more Americans a voice. That’s why the Senate should do the right thing and protect what so many generations fought so hard to secure."
206,BarackObama,"It was great speaking with the @MBK_Alliance Advisory Council, and hearing more about the work they’re doing to make a difference in the lives of boys and young men of color across the country. https://t.co/b4bpZZXP11"
207,BarackObama,"General Colin Powell understood what was best in this country, and tried to bring his own life, career, and public statements in line with that ideal. Michelle and I will always look to him as an example of what America—and Americans—can and should be. https://t.co/vSxTbUE5aR"
208,BarackObama,"Congrats to our new WNBA champs, @ChicagoSky! I couldn’t be prouder of this team — they worked hard for this moment, and have made our city proud. https://t.co/Da9cLtvSX4"
209,BarackObama,"Today, we lost an icon with the passing of Timuel Black. Over his 102 years, Tim was many things: a veteran, historian, author, educator, civil rights leader, and humanitarian. Michelle and I send our thoughts to his family, and everyone who loved him. https://t.co/EDxgIGbZHB"
210,BarackObama,"I was deeply saddened to learn about the passing of General Ray Odierno after a battle with cancer. He devoted his life to serving this country, and for that I will always be grateful. Michelle and I send our thoughts to his wife Linda, and their children. https://t.co/25EWqyAXdI"
211,BarackObama,"Congratulations to Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov. This award is a tribute to their extraordinary courage and the enduring value of fact-based journalism and freedom of expression, which is under threat in far too many places today. https://t.co/bEcbuOZ5pn"
212,BarackObama,"And of course, I’m excited for my @WhiteSox to be back in the playoffs. It’s going to be hard to top a walk-off home run on the Field of Dreams, but if any team can do it, it’s this one. Go Sox! https://t.co/vymsDfGpCW"
213,BarackObama,"It’s always good to be from Chicago, but this year is especially sweet. Congratulations to the @ChicagoSky for making it to the WNBA finals, and to the legend, @Candace_Parker, for making all of us proud. We’ll be rooting for you. https://t.co/yW4d1OUYpF"
214,BarackObama,"If we don’t stand up for democracy, we’ll see this type of gerrymandering happen in even more states. It’s why @DemRedistrict is fighting for #FairMaps. And it’s why the Senate must pass the Freedom to Vote Act to protect our communities from partisan gerrymandering."
215,BarackObama,"And in Georgia, Republicans released a congressional map that decreases the voting power of communities of color – including African Americans in a historically Black district – and ignores how the state has changed."
216,BarackObama,"In Texas, for example, Republicans recently passed a law making voting harder, especially for people of color. Now they’re advancing a new congressional map that’s tilted in their favor and doesn’t reflect the state’s growth. https://t.co/VRvoLXZsPq"
217,BarackObama,"Right now, state legislatures across the country are setting new boundaries for state legislative and congressional districts. And in many states, Republicans are drawing maps that allow them to hold onto power."
218,BarackObama,"Our latest production from Higher Ground, Ada Twist, Scientist, is now on Netflix. Based on the book series, the show will continue the work we started at the White House Science Fair. We hope it inspires more young people to discover science and use their imagination to create. https://t.co/qbQgnksXCG"
219,BarackObama,"Happy anniversary, Miche! Over the past 29 years, I've loved watching the world get to know you not just as a daughter of the South Side, but as a mother, lawyer, executive, author, First Lady, and my best friend. I can’t imagine life without you. https://t.co/SEXc9jMXPl"

225,BarackObama,"If we want to give our children and grandchildren a brighter future, the wealthiest Americans and large corporations must pay their fair share in taxes. https://t.co/zqlZr6UpLe"
226,BarackObama,"The repeal of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ allowed these two Marines to be true to themselves while serving in our military. Listen to their story: https://t.co/A7jxXTG1G1"
227,BarackObama,"Ten years ago today, we repealed ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ Today our military is stronger and our country is safer because patriotic Americans no longer have to live a lie in order to defend the country they love. https://t.co/uXKSnsflMk"
228,BarackObama,"Wishing my friend @JustinTrudeau the best in Canada’s upcoming election. Justin has been an effective leader and strong voice for democratic values, and I’m proud of the work we did together."
229,BarackObama,"The Freedom to Vote Act just introduced in the Senate would strengthen our democracy by making it easier for people to vote and harder for politicians and special interests to drown out the voices of ordinary Americans. I support it, and every Senator should do the same."
230,BarackObama,"Many of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life. With the launch of https://t.co/2CLx31kMeN, we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity. I hope you'll join us. https://t.co/oi0NNIBihQ"
231,BarackObama,"Today we honor the nearly 3,000 men, women, and children who died on September 11, 2001, and the heroes who have always run towards danger to do what’s right. Let’s never forget that day, and let’s never take them for granted. https://t.co/VkN11wZAMh"
232,BarackObama,It was great speaking with @Surgeon_General Murthy and the COVID-19 Community Corps volunteers across the country who've been spending their time and energy encouraging their communities to get vaccinated. Their work is making a difference and will help us end this pandemic. https://t.co/t4yoLaibrU
233,BarackObama,"California! You’ve got a big choice to make by September 14, and everything is on the line. Your vote could be the difference between protecting our kids or putting them at risk; helping Californians recover or taking us backwards. Vote “no” on the Republican recall."
234,BarackObama,Great memories of an important day. 31 million people now have health insurance—and the peace of mind that comes with it—thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Now @POTUS is committed to making it even stronger through his Build Back Better plan. https://t.co/RRgs0heacp
235,BarackObama,"The pandemic has devastated communities everywhere. But the young leaders in our newest class of @ObamaFoundation Scholars studying at @UChicago and @Columbia give me hope for a better future. Congratulations, Scholars! https://t.co/QWpgaxfwvg"
236,BarackObama,"Labor Day is about honoring folks like Maurice Harris—a devoted husband and father of five, who has spent his career working in the trades in Chicago. He'll soon help build our Obama Presidential Center. Here’s his incredible story: https://t.co/ibiXpJpT5K"
237,BarackObama,"This Labor Day, let’s honor all the working men and women who make this country what it is—and the American labor movement that has helped protect them, especially during this pandemic."

298,BarackObama,"Today, more people in more places are seeing the world more clearly than they did a year ago. It’s a tribute to all those who decided that this time would be different—and that they, in their own ways, would help make it different."
299,BarackObama,"George Floyd was murdered one year ago today. Since then, hundreds more Americans have died in encounters with police—parents, sons, daughters, friends taken from us far too soon. But the last year has also given us reasons to hope."

316,BarackObama,States have just learned how many seats they have in Congress for the next decade. This process is an important step in making sure our maps—and electoral process—better reflect our communities. Get involved in the fight for fair maps with @AllOnTheLine: https://t.co/hudtiWoZjW

345,BarackObama,The Affordable Care Act has helped 20 million Americans get coverage—and up to 130 million Americans can no longer be denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It has been a lifeline for Americans who've lost their jobs and their health insurance during the pandemic.
346,BarackObama,"As part of the American Rescue Plan, @POTUS just signed the largest expansion of health care since the Affordable Care Act. It’s an example of how government is supposed to work, and exactly what I hoped would happen when I signed the ACA into law 11 years ago today. https://t.co/G7WUgYdxOp"
347,BarackObama,A once-in-a-century pandemic cannot be the only thing that slows mass shootings in this country. It’s time for leaders everywhere to listen to the American people when they say enough is enough. https://t.co/7MEJ87Is3E

355,BarackObama,"Even as we’ve battled the pandemic, we’ve continued to neglect the longer-lasting epidemic of gun violence in America. Although the shooter’s motive is not yet clear, the identity of the victims underscores an alarming rise in anti-Asian violence that must end."

367,BarackObama,"And as we rightly celebrate what Democrats accomplished in the 2020 election, it’s always worth analyzing those successes in depth—and looking at where we came up short—as we look toward future cycles. This interview includes some ideas worth considering: https://t.co/c75VpLwkgD"

380,BarackObama,"For decades, John Lewis not only gave all of himself to the cause of freedom and justice, but inspired generations that followed to try to live up to his example. On his birthday, we honor his memory, and work toward continuing his legacy by creating change in our communities."
381,BarackObama,"I want to share this inspiring book about the events leading up to the 1960 election, from Dr. King's imprisonment to student activism in Atlanta to JFK's campaign. It's a story we can all learn from—a story of overlooked heroes and the power each of us has to create change. https://t.co/yIaNJpRq7M"
382,BarackObama,Congrats to @NASAJPL on landing @MarsPersevere today! Looking forward to seeing what this mission uncovers—and proud our administration invested in this effort eight years ago to help continue America’s rich tradition of exploration and discovery.

576,BarackObama,I’ve known Senator @KamalaHarris for a long time. She is more than prepared for the job. She’s spent her career defending our Constitution and fighting for folks who need a fair shake. This is a good day for our country. Now let’s go win this thing. https://t.co/duJhFhWp6g
577,BarackObama,"I will never forget the commitment to reconciliation and peace that I encountered in Hiroshima in 2016. The memory of August 6, 1945, must never fade; it allows us to fight complacency. It fuels our moral imagination. It allows us to change. https://t.co/A9lKu0c0PR"
578,BarackObama,"We have to treat voting as the most important action we can take on behalf of democracy. So make sure you are registered to vote. Request a mail-in ballot early and send it back early. Then get your family and friends to do it, too. Every vote counts. https://t.co/XdZz4dh82T"
579,BarackObama,"Let’s guarantee that every citizen has equal representation in our government. And end partisan gerrymandering, so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians. And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster—a Jim Crow relic––then that’s what we should do."
580,BarackObama,"We can do this by making sure every American is automatically registered to vote, including formerly incarcerated people. Let’s also make sure to add more polling places, expand early voting, and make Election Day a national holiday."
581,BarackObama,"We've got to fight harder to protect the right to vote. It’s one of the most powerful tools we have––and we can start by passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Once we pass that, we should continue marching forward to make it even better."
582,BarackObama,"Today is the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act––one of the crowning achievements of our democracy. But once the Supreme Court weakened it, some state legislatures unleashed a flood of laws designed specifically to make voting harder, especially in communities of color."
583,BarackObama,"I’m proud to endorse this diverse and hopeful collection of thoughtful, empathetic, and highly qualified Democrats. If you’re in one of their districts or states, make sure you vote for them this fall. And if you can, vote early—by mail or in person. https://t.co/PSm3Rf3wkF https://t.co/7RXrJriBz8"
584,BarackObama,"Welcome home, @AstroBehnken and @Astro_Doug! We launched the Commercial Crew program to strengthen our U.S. space program and it's been great to see its success.

585,BarackObama,This pandemic is far from over––and our medical professionals continue to put their lives on the line to keep our country going. @JoeBiden and I had a chance to thank Dr. @Craig_A_Spencer for his work during the Ebola crisis and this current pandemic. https://t.co/FlyGFIUHl7
586,BarackObama,"John believed that in all of us, there exists the capacity for great courage and a longing to do what’s right. We are so lucky to have had him show us the way. I offered some thoughts today on his life and how, like him, we can give it all we have. https://t.co/7UHT86OzEj"

594,BarackObama,Doesn’t get much better than sitting down to talk with my friend Joe. https://t.co/5a5VWua1JD
595,BarackObama,"Ten years ago, I signed Wall Street reform into law. It was the most sweeping set of financial regulations since the Great Depression—and it’s still working today to prevent another one. Now, it’s up to us to protect it and keep fighting for an economy that works for everybody. https://t.co/jbV7p64xZR"

600,BarackObama,Get registered and find out how you can vote by mail at https://t.co/JQJjdF7JxM.

602,BarackObama,"It’s clear our communities are crying out for change—and what that change looks like is up to us. That’s why it’s important to take a hard look at all the perspectives and proposals out there, even the ones we disagree with. It’s how we’ll come up with solutions that last."
603,BarackObama,"Finally, here’s a look at how Germany reshaped police training after the horrors of World War II and how this approach might be useful to other countries today.

609,BarackObama,"This holiday weekend, let’s be safe and smart. It’s going to take all of us to beat this virus. So wear a mask. Wash your hands. And listen to the experts, not the folks trying to divide us. That's the only way we’ll do this—together.
https://t.co/UwNKAzL8JU"
610,BarackObama,"Today I’m tipping my hat to all the giants in the Negro Leagues, from Satchel Paige to Toni Stone and so many others. Their brave example, first set 100 years ago, changed America’s pastime for the better––opening it up for new generations of players and fans alike. https://t.co/05jWocKs17"
611,BarackObama,"Jim’s courage and persistence helped change America for the better. And so did every American who marched, organized, stood up, came out—or changed their own heart because they love someone who did. Happy anniversary, everybody. https://t.co/t8ULh2c0P5"
612,BarackObama,Michelle and I want every kid in Chicago to grow up knowing even better opportunities than we had. We’re happy to help Chicago Connected reach every kid in the city. This is where I found a purpose and a family––and it’ll always be our home. https://t.co/ofSCxK8cJC
613,BarackObama,"I’m joining my friend @JoeBiden tomorrow to talk about everything that’s at stake in this election. 

I hope you’ll join us, too. This is a critical moment in our history––and all of us have to do our part to build this country into what we know it can be. https://t.co/diQxk3uFH2"
614,BarackObama,"Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory, or an acceptance of the way things are. It's a celebration of progress. It's an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible––and there is still so much work to do.
https://t.co/5XCRdnk3iR"
615,BarackObama,"...and now to stand up for those ideals, we have to move forward and elect @JoeBiden and a Democratic Congress that does its job, protects DREAMers, and finally creates a system that’s truly worthy of this nation of immigrants once and for all."
616,BarackObama,"Eight years ago this week, we protected young people who were raised as part of our American family from deportation. Today, I'm happy for them, their families, and all of us. We may look different and come from everywhere, but what makes us American are our shared ideals…"

620,BarackObama,"This young generation makes me optimistic about our future. By protesting, they’re speaking up and shining a light on injustice––and one way we can support them is to vote for people who’ll change the laws on every level.
https://t.co/3Ng1IC73nY"
621,BarackObama,"In Columbia, Maryland, young people wielded social media to connect across boundaries, amplify voices, and enact some real change.

622,BarackObama,"This group of Nashville teens led a peaceful march with tens of thousands of people in their community. 
https://t.co/KWVsI0Z53E"
623,BarackObama,"Over the past few weeks, we’ve seen young people in every corner of the country step up and become leaders. Through organization and mobilization, they’re showing us how we can sustain this momentum to bring about real change. https://t.co/UKnowQM2Lj"
624,BarackObama,"It’s too early to tell if it’s permanent, but the changes brought on by COVID-19 are forcing many of us to reflect on what really matters in our lives. https://t.co/9qlOdWKAuO"
625,BarackObama,"As has always been true at key moments in history, it’s going to depend on young people to go out there and rewrite what is possible.

I couldn’t be prouder of all the young people leading that change right now. Here’s my advice for the Class of 2020: https://t.co/XD2n7LEihk"
626,BarackObama,"We’ve seen the power that our voices have when we speak out about injustice––but we also know the toll that it takes on our mental health. Today, I talked to @repjohnlewis, Bryan Stevenson, and @MBK_Alliance activists about ways to keep our mental health a priority at this time. https://t.co/PAsWb607EU"
627,BarackObama,"On National Gun Violence Awareness Day, we #WearOrange to honor the victims and survivors of gun violence––which continues to disproportionately harm Black communities. Then keep speaking up, voting, and changing laws across the country."
628,BarackObama,"Third, every city in this country should be a @MBK_Alliance community. We have 250 cities, counties, and tribal nations working to reduce barriers and expand opportunity for boys and young men of color. Join us: https://t.co/RZRwimA3SO"
629,BarackObama,"Second, every mayor should review their use of force policies with members of their community and commit to report on planned reforms. We need mayors, county executives, and those in positions of power to make this a priority. Take the pledge: https://t.co/c8pAlhJsPJ"
630,BarackObama,"First, there are specific evidence-based reforms that would build trust, save lives, and lead to a decrease in crime, too. You can find clear, actionable recommendations right here: https://t.co/V7b0mJoZiL"
631,BarackObama,"Real change requires protest to highlight a problem, and politics to implement practical solutions and laws. As I mentioned yesterday in our @MBK_Alliance town hall, there are several steps our mayors and elected officials can take right now:"
632,BarackObama,"In our @MBK_Alliance town hall yesterday, I mentioned James Baldwin's The Fire Next Time. From 1962, it remains a seminal meditation on race by one of our greatest writers and relevant for understanding the pain and anger behind the protests. Excerpt: https://t.co/50F9ZP3JhQ"
633,BarackObama,"And third, an extraordinary essay by the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the U.S. Armed Forces, Mike Mullen, explaining the values at risk when we start using our military to control domestic protests.

https://t.co/U0z9wMOx8z"
635,BarackObama,"Here’s a useful read––a reminder of the importance of de-escalation by police in their interactions with protestors.

https://t.co/Ondw85gQNL"
636,BarackObama,"""Let’s do this another way. Let's stop thinking our voice don’t matter and vote. Not just for the president...educate yourself and know who you’re voting for. And that’s how we're going to hit 'em."" https://t.co/WX6oLNRtI2"
637,BarackObama,Let’s get to work. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv
638,BarackObama,"I know the past few months have been hard and dispiriting. But watching the heightened activism of young people makes me hopeful. And if we can keep channeling our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, this can be the moment when real change starts."
639,BarackObama,"If you want to take concrete action, but you’re not sure how, we’ve created a site to connect you with useful resources and organizations who’ve been fighting the good fight at the local and national levels for years. https://t.co/2KcB4T3b0I"
640,BarackObama,"5. The more specific we can make demands for criminal justice and police reform, the harder it will be for elected officials to just offer lip service to the cause and then fall back into business as usual once protests have gone away."
641,BarackObama,"4. So if we want to bring about real change, the choice isn’t between protest and politics––we have to do both. We have to mobilize to raise awareness, and we have to organize and cast our ballots to make sure that we elect candidates who will act on reform."
642,BarackObama,"3. To do that, we have to know which levels of government have the biggest impact. Changing the federal government is important. But the elected officials who matter most in reforming police departments and the criminal justice system work at the state and local levels."
643,BarackObama,"2. The point of protest is to raise public awareness, to put a spotlight on injustice, and to make the powers that be uncomfortable. But eventually, we have to translate those aspirations into specific laws and institutional practices."
644,BarackObama,1. The protests represent a genuine and legitimate frustration over a decades-long failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system. We should condemn the few who resort to violence––not the overwhelming majority who deserve our respect and support.
645,BarackObama,"Ultimately, it’s going to be up to a new generation of activists to shape strategies that best fit the times. But I want to highlight some basic lessons from past efforts that are worth remembering:"
646,BarackObama,"As millions of people across the country take to the streets and raise their voices in response to the killing of George Floyd and the ongoing problem of unequal justice, I’ve heard many ask how we can sustain momentum to bring about real change."
647,BarackObama,I wrote out some thoughts on how to make this moment a real turning point to bring about real change––and pulled together some resources to help young activists sustain the momentum by channeling their energy into concrete action. https://t.co/jEczrOeFdv

650,BarackObama,"On Memorial Day, we honor those who gave all for us. That takes different forms this year, but it’s even more vital with the loss of so many veterans to COVID-19.

659,BarackObama,"Michelle and I want to do our part to give all you parents a break today, so we’re reading “The Word Collector” for @chipublib. It’s a fun book that vividly illustrates the transformative power of words––and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did. https://t.co/ADYbL6Dzg4"
660,BarackObama,"Despite all the time that’s been lost, we can still make real progress against the virus, protect people from the economic fallout, and more safely approach something closer to normal if we start making better policy decisions now.

663,BarackObama,"There’s no limit to the devotion I’ve seen in teachers like these @ChiPubSchools educators. Their dedication shapes the best parts of who we become.

665,BarackObama,"The folks of the Chicago @fooddepository—and food banks in communities like yours—are working overtime to feed the vulnerable and families who’ve fallen on hard times.

666,BarackObama,"The pandemic has magnified the financial insecurity of too many American families, the deep and real racial disparities in our society – and the imbalanced burdens on working moms. We have to create something better for America on the other side of this. https://t.co/eyy3dC22Ze"
667,BarackObama,"In moments of crisis, we look out for one other.

668,BarackObama,This pandemic has painfully brought to the surface many of the reasons I launched @MBK_Alliance—structural racism robs too many of our kids of their futures.

669,BarackObama,"If we want life to approach anything like normal anytime soon, we need a comprehensive testing program. It’s not going to be cheap, but it will ultimately pay off many times over in saved lives, saved businesses, and saved jobs. https://t.co/pnN9KVcvQR"
670,BarackObama,"While we continue to wait for a coherent national plan to navigate this pandemic, states like Massachusetts are beginning to adopt their own public health plans to combat this virus––before it's too late. https://t.co/Eb2Hz8H8vU"
671,BarackObama,"We've all had to adapt to cope with a pandemic. Climate change will force far harsher changes on our kids. All of us should follow the young people who've led the efforts to protect our planet for generations, and demand more of our leaders at every level. https://t.co/uNueQl5bNX"

685,BarackObama,"Mayors have been working hard to help us get through this pandemic, and they’ll have just as big a task to help people through hard times ahead.

686,BarackObama,"Through centuries of persecution, exile and struggle, the story of Passover has reminded the Jewish people––and all of humanity––of the power to overcome even the greatest of odds. Michelle and I send our warmest wishes to those celebrating with loved ones at home or virtually."
687,BarackObama,"Social distancing bends the curve and relieves some pressure on our heroic medical professionals. But in order to shift off current policies, the key will be a robust system of testing and monitoring – something we have yet to put in place nationwide. https://t.co/evkTSrzReB"
688,BarackObama,"My advisor and friend @cecmunoz has been someone I’ve turned to for years. In her new book, More Than Ready, she shares her story and an empowering message to women, especially women of color, that they are the leaders we need to make a change in our world. https://t.co/6bQski6N23"
