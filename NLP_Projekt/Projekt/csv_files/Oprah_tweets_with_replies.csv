9154,Oprah,"@KimKardashian ""I would rather have been beaten up in the media, than live a life that was unhappy"". That to me was truthful and powerful."
9155,Oprah,@3LWTV @KimKardashian the big aha for me was the fact that so many women STAY in bad relationships knowing it's going nowhere.
9156,Oprah,@SheriSalata big shout out to our OWN/HARPO team for editing 8 hrs of tape and crafting the best of this interview into 2 hrs in record time

9238,Oprah,@3LWTV @50cent I STILL don't know why.
9239,Oprah,50's response the most honest I've heard..couldn't be your friend so worked at being your enemy.
9240,Oprah,"@Youcan353 just switched to  watching Paris Jackson, waiting  on 50 #NextChapter"
