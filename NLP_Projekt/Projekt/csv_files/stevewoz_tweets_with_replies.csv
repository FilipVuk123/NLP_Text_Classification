8,stevewoz,"@ellemm8ch Correct. Tesla horrible, even compared to our Bolt EV. But when it's extremely tinny, you notice. We had to turn off favorite songs partway through the one time we tried Spotify. Normally we stream on Apple Music, at home and in the car. Tesla is never very satisfying for music."
9,stevewoz,@Colby80 We are constantly on long road trips over deserts and mountains and cellular is spotty. The sats are there. There is a large difference in music quality between stations on SiriusXM too. I don't know if that is hardware (bandwidth limiting) or software (station choices).
10,stevewoz,"@ucpete At home, SiriusXM is a poor choice for music, but on long road trips, over deserts and mountains, cellular connection is spotty but the sats are always there."
11,stevewoz,"@IAmElMexiken @DrSej With the Tesla premium sound system, even our Bolt EV sounded better. Tesla is low for sound quality."
12,stevewoz,I cancelled my Spotify account. There are plenty of alternatives . It’s not just Joe Rogen or Neil Young. Recently our Tesla SiriusXM radio went out so I listened to a favorite song on Spotify. The sound was  tinny and awful.  Spotify doesn't care about the same things that I do.

83,stevewoz,@TBYRD Apple sounded like a good name. We did have to pay huge amounts of money to the Beatles in later years because their record company was Apple Records and they pointed to ways that our computers could make music.

6475,stevewoz,Getting ready for Mountain Time showing of Big Bang Theory. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6476,stevewoz,I am at home and seldom make it to my office at Fusion-io - I need the remote presence device! #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6477,stevewoz,"The producers thought this episode was one of the funniest, but it's subjective. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV"
6478,stevewoz,I love Iowa but don't get there often...sign anyone's Apple ][ of course. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6479,stevewoz,The writers came up with some of the best lines on the fly after watching one take. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6480,stevewoz,They have to have done things very personal and creative to be gods to me. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6481,stevewoz,It's hard for me to speak to very few people. But even a youngster can be a god to me. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6482,stevewoz,I met and talked with all the cast except Jim Parsons. It's hard to talk to a 'god'. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6483,stevewoz,He said that maybe someday I could create a whiteboard for Sheldon. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6484,stevewoz,I met the professor who creates the accurate physics - incredibly difficult lines. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6485,stevewoz,First time I watched the show I loved Sheldon and related. The physics is real stuff. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6486,stevewoz,Live shooting probably 2 hours - some time for set moves. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6487,stevewoz,Google founders each have 5 of those devices. They can be at the office when at home I guess. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6488,stevewoz,Willow Garage makes the remote presence devices but the show called them virtual presence. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6489,stevewoz,They measure the distance to the camera for each scene so that they can do it identically on Tuesday. Continuity if necessary. What (cont…
6490,stevewoz,…cont) if a cast member couldn't make it on Tuesday? #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6491,stevewoz,They shoot everything on Monday but do the real live audience show on Tuesday. You can get tickets somehow. Every scene gets done (cont…
6492,stevewoz,…cont) twice and they have the Monday shots as backup. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6493,stevewoz,I stayed another day to watch the live audience filming. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6494,stevewoz,It takes the staff a full week to create an episode but my cameo part only took a day. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6495,stevewoz,"Berneese, it's really me this time. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV"
6496,stevewoz,dognaps jokes very funny #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6497,stevewoz,"If questions come up about show issues, I can answer them from having been there #thebigbangtheory #yapTV"
6498,stevewoz,I'll be on yap.tv for Big Bang Theory until 9PM PDT tonight #thebigbangtheory #yapTV
6499,stevewoz,Woz here in yap.tv - on West Coast so I'm not able to watch Big Bang Theory yet. #thebigbangtheory #yapTV

6526,stevewoz,I typed a 'c' in recuerdo but my iPhone got it wrong and I mistakingly decided that my phone was signalling me that I was wrong.
6527,stevewoz,Plastic Logic - we each get one at D conference. Earlier someone from the company told me it has 3G.
6528,stevewoz,Plastic Logic - like Kindle but so thin (like iPod Touch) I'd pay much more for one.
6529,stevewoz,Too many flash camcorders (I have many) skipped the easy way to import my videos.
