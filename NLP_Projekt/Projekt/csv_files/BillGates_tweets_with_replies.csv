33,BillGates,"I was shocked to wake up to the news this morning. A reversal of Roe v. Wade would set us back 50 years and disproportionately impact the most vulnerable women in society.

113,BillGates,"Thanks @devisridhar for taking the time today to discuss omicron, vaccines, and how the world can come together to prevent the next pandemic. https://t.co/WY5P7xluwe"
114,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov @trvrb .@DrTedros  has started the conversation about how we avoid the next pandemic which is important. I appreciate your work on this. We can do a lot better next time!!#
115,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov A more transmissive variant is not likely but we have been surprised a lot during this pandemic. Omicron will create a lot of immunity at least for the next year. @trvrb  tracks the genetics really well. We may have to take yearly shots for Covid for some time.
116,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov As countries experience their Omicron wave health systems will be challenged. Most of the severe cases will be unvaccinated people. Once Omicron goes through a country then the rest of the year should see far fewer cases so Covid can be treated more like seasonal flu.
117,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov The data is pretty strong that it came from another species which is true for most pandemics. People will continue to speculate on this and we should make sure labs are careful. There will be future outbreaks coming from other species so we need to invest in being ready. #
118,BillGates,"@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov I am optimistic about polio eradication - we are close. Malaria, HIV, Nutrition, will take a lot longer but better tools are coming. Education also needs innovation - it is behind where global health is particularly for girls.#"
119,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov From 2000 to the start of the pandemic we made strong progress on health and other goals. The pandemic is a huge setback - including rich countries not focusing on the needs of developing countries as much. I hope we can reverse that.
120,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi @WHO @CDCgov People like you and I and Tony Fauci have been subject to a lot of misinformation. I didn't expect that. Some of it like me putting chips in arms doesn't make sense to me - why would I want to do that?#
121,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi Trusted authorities like @WHO  and @CDCgov need more resources to see the pandemic early (surveillance) and to communicate better. Social media got behind on trying to get factual information out - there will be a lot of debate about how to do better on that...
122,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi Do you think the world will come together to get ready for the next one? I hope so but I am not sure.#
123,BillGates,"@devisridhar @gavi Also some countries did a better job of reducing mobility, using masks and protecting the elderly.

We weren't prepared - no practice in advance.#"
124,BillGates,@devisridhar @gavi A few countries like Australia moved fast to diagnose cases at scale and isolate people who were infected. They were able to limit deaths dramatically. Once the numbers get large in a country it is too late. So the first few months made a lot of difference.
125,BillGates,@devisridhar When we have adequate supply then tiered pricing is used where the rich countries pay a lot more than middle income and low income pay the least which is funded by @gavi. When supply is limited rich countries have to not outbid the others so governments are key to this. #
126,BillGates,@devisridhar mRna vaccines still can't meet all the demand so figuring out who gets what is complicated.#
127,BillGates,@devisridhar During 2021 the supply of vaccines was limited and they mostly went to wealthy countries. Now we have a lot of supply overall and the problems are logistics and demand. The health systems in developing countries are a limiting factor.
128,BillGates,"@devisridhar The vaccines we have prevent severe disease and death very well but they are missing two key things.

First they still allow infections (""breakthrough"") and the duration appears to be limited.

We need vaccines that prevent re-infection and have many years of duration.#"
129,BillGates,"I'm excited to talk with @DeviSridhar today about her work at the University of Edinburgh Medical School and @GlobalHealthGP, and to answer some of your questions about what we’ve been learning recently about the pandemic. #"

139,BillGates,"If there’s good news here, it’s that omicron moves so quickly that once it becomes dominant in a country, the wave there should last less than 3 months. Those few months could be bad, but I still believe if we take the right steps, the pandemic can be over in 2022."
140,BillGates,"There will be more breakthrough cases in people who are vx’d, which sounds concerning but is purely a factor of how many people are vx’d and how fast this variant is spreading. Vaccines are designed to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying &amp; are doing that well."
141,BillGates,"In the meantime, we all have to look out for each other, especially the most vulnerable, whether they live down the street or in another country. That means wearing masks, avoiding big indoor gatherings, and getting vaccinated. Getting a booster gives the best protection."
142,BillGates,"The big unknown is how sick omicron makes you. We need to take it seriously until we know more about it. Even if it’s only half as severe as delta, it will be the worst surge we have seen so far because it’s so infectious."
143,BillGates,Omicron is spreading faster than any virus in history. It will soon be in every country in the world.
144,BillGates,"Just when it seemed like life would return to normal, we could be entering the worst part of the pandemic. Omicron will hit home for all of us. Close friends of mine now have it, and I’ve canceled most of my holiday plans."

Which do you like better?"
161,BillGates,"There’s lots of speculation about what Shakespeare’s life was really like, but we do know that his son died at age 11. Hamnet shares the story of how grief tore the Shakespeare family apart. https://t.co/KrNPsGvcXv"
162,BillGates,"When I was a kid, I was obsessed with science fiction. But @andyweirauthor’s latest book Project Hail Mary is a fun read even if you aren’t a sci-fi fan. I finished the whole thing in one weekend. https://t.co/Ctv8WCNriN"

221,BillGates,"Still, the disparities in access to the COVID-19 vaccine are shocking and unjust. Only 2 percent of people in low-income countries have received any COVID-19 vaccines. And the gap may be getting even larger as rich-world governments buy up extra doses to serve as booster shots."
222,BillGates,"Inequity in health is not new. Each year, more than 5 million children—almost entirely in low- and middle-income countries—die before their fifth birthday from mostly preventable diseases. Reducing this gap has been the Gates Foundation’s top priority for more than 20 years."
223,BillGates,The pandemic has worsened inequities. But it's also shown the world what's possible when we come together. Read why there's reason to be optimistic in our 2021 Goalkeepers Report. https://t.co/2XUNjdwCyf

250,BillGates,"Of course, the full extent of the pandemic’s impact on the SDGs will take years to fully understand, as more and better data becomes available. And this data doesn’t diminish the very real suffering the pandemic has caused for people everywhere—far from it."
251,BillGates,Initial projections about the pandemic’s impact on the fight against malaria were dire. But that projection spurred many countries to action to ensure that bed nets were distributed and that testing and antimalarial drugs remained available.
252,BillGates,"When the pandemic hit, many feared the worst when it came to maintaining progress on fighting other diseases. But all over the world people stepped up to avert the worst-case scenarios. One example is malaria: https://t.co/InzRGXGtyc https://t.co/aM5mszTtWR"

396,BillGates,"The President’s commitment to reengage with the world gives me hope that the recovery will reach everyone, including communities of color in the U.S. and people in poor countries around the world."
397,BillGates,"With Americans across the country working together, more people get a COVID-19 vaccine every day, bringing us closer to a time when life will look much more like normal. Until then, we can slow the spread of the virus and save lives by continuing to distance and wear masks."
398,BillGates,"I look forward to working with President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris to tackle some of our toughest challenges like COVID-19 and climate change. This has been a troubling time in America, but I see promise in the months and years ahead."
399,BillGates,"#MLKDay has long been a national day of service. As we celebrate the first without Congressman John Lewis, I'm thinking about his powerful call to remain hopeful about the future as we work to make our country—and our world—a better place. https://t.co/RpmKvrzjPo"

405,BillGates,This book has nothing to do with viruses or pandemics. But it is surprisingly relevant for these times. @exlarson provides a brilliant and gripping account of another era of widespread anxiety: the years 1940 and 1941. https://t.co/cm6IunxOZL
406,BillGates,"Monoclonal antibodies are one of the most promising treatments we have for COVID-19, thanks in large part to R&amp;D by Canadian scientists. Because of their generosity, people all around the world will have access to this potentially lifesaving treatment. https://t.co/2flhbV7e4n"

413,BillGates,"This new quiz from @Gapminder is a clever way to fight misconceptions and “upgrade your worldview” about the incredible progress the world has made toward the Sustainable Development Goals to end poverty, fight inequality, and stop climate change: https://t.co/Qo0oaxv1tb"
414,BillGates,"Rashida Jones and I talked to Yuval Noah Harari about COVID conspiracy theories, the role social media plays in spreading misinformation, and the one lie I choose to believe even though I know it’s not always true: https://t.co/7pzUFsMf5D https://t.co/YEjZaXLTbJ"
415,BillGates,"I believe we can avoid a climate disaster—if we deploy the clean-energy tools we have now wisely, and if we make big breakthroughs that touch every aspect of our physical economy. Creating the National Institutes of Energy Innovation would put us on the right path."
416,BillGates,"To reduce duplication, focus the government’s efforts, and get the most innovation out of every dollar of funding, we should create a new organization: the National Institutes of Energy Innovation."
417,BillGates,"We need to revolutionize the world’s physical economy—and that will take, among other things, a dramatic infusion of ingenuity, funding, and focus from the federal government."
418,BillGates,This the most important thing the U.S. can do to lead the world in innovations that will solve climate change. https://t.co/LG9uOnM92r
419,BillGates,I’m inspired by Quarraisha Abdool Karim and @ProfAbdoolKarim. They are two of the most respected HIV/AIDS researchers in the world. And now they are helping guide the COVID-19 response in South Africa and around the globe. https://t.co/1gBweBAneA #WorldAIDSDay
420,BillGates,I’m a big fan of author @harari_yuval and was excited to talk to him about why humanity is so willing to believe falsehoods and what these lies tell us about ourselves—both as individuals and as a society. https://t.co/yREVfCds3v

444,BillGates,"The only way to eliminate the threat of COVID-19 somewhere is to eliminate it everywhere. By making sure poor countries are equipped to stop this disease, wealthy countries will help themselves and bring this crisis to an end sooner. https://t.co/CzFHuwdPcS"
445,BillGates,Understanding this concept can help us measure our progress toward eliminating carbon emissions and serve as a guide to action. https://t.co/xA0rjh8xBk
446,BillGates,Developing and manufacturing vaccines won’t end the pandemic quickly unless we also deliver them equitably. Here is why it’s critical that vaccines are distributed in proportion to the global population: https://t.co/XFTYVZ2C2N https://t.co/ZL0ulACxdM
447,BillGates,Great to see the UK commit vital funding to ensure COVID-19 vaccines are available for the world’s poorest people. PM @BorisJohnson's plan will improve the way we prepare for future crises like this. https://t.co/SMzVlVpEyQ
448,BillGates,"After 20 years of stunning advances toward global goals to improve health and reduce poverty, the COVID-19 pandemic stopped progress in its tracks. In our foundation’s Goalkeepers report, we survey the damage and discuss how to start reversing it. https://t.co/5e41bGrlUp"

455,BillGates,Clinical trials are critical to helping researchers better understand Alzheimer's. Improving how we identify and enroll participants in those trials will accelerate progress on diagnosing and treating the disease. https://t.co/PLUhTVOylO
456,BillGates,I tackle every big new problem by asking two questions: Who has dealt with this problem well? And what can we learn from them? @ExemplarsHealth will help to fill the gap in global health knowledge sharing and to accelerate progress in saving lives. https://t.co/5OhO10BVVP

460,BillGates,"If we’re going to address climate change, we need to find new ways to do things that don’t release greenhouse gases—including how we move around. https://t.co/ElpoZs2ZHG"
461,BillGates,Today we move one step closer toward a world without polio. This is an incredible milestone that’s worth celebrating. It is also an important reminder of what can be accomplished when we work together toward a common goal. https://t.co/Exxks9jF4q
462,BillGates,Mosquito City is home to the world’s largest captive colony of mosquitoes. @IfakaraHealth Institute is doing fascinating research there about mosquito behaviors and finding ways to outsmart them. https://t.co/p3r11gMqdn
463,BillGates,Deaths from malaria have been cut by more than half since the year 2000. Increased bed net use is one of the main reasons why https://t.co/qxMqqCUs11 #WorldMosquitoDay
464,BillGates,"Ridding the world of preventable, treatable diseases like malaria will save millions of lives and lead to healthier, more prosperous communities. And that will make them better prepared to confront any new health challenges like COVID-19 in the future. https://t.co/6AbgoLSVai https://t.co/D6xm7XeuBH"
465,BillGates,The progress the world has made against malaria is one of the greatest success stories ever. The COVID-19 pandemic only reinforces why eradicating malaria is so essential. https://t.co/aEtxSWNegs
466,BillGates,"Move aside, @SharkWeek. This is the still the world’s deadliest killer: https://t.co/AOi5VSmfLF https://t.co/3GLwnkinlI"
467,BillGates,"Because of long-standing barriers that are made worse by COVID-19, hundreds of thousands of students with promise may never start college. This would be disastrous for these young people and for the country. Here’s what we’re doing to help: https://t.co/2NqFWLr30o"
468,BillGates,Teaching special education takes an amazing person to figure out exactly what works for each child. Talking with Washington State Teacher of the Year Amy Campbell gave me an even greater appreciation for these educators: https://t.co/YIxI1eoMkG https://t.co/kOY0tciVAp

510,BillGates,"In the meantime, frontline health care workers are making heroic efforts to test and treat patients across the United States and the world. Here in my hometown, Public Health Seattle &amp; King County (@KCPubHealth) is doing incredible work that we should all be very proud of."
511,BillGates,"All the work that rich countries are doing now to develop vaccines will save lives in developing countries too. Without a vaccine, those countries are at even greater risk than wealthy ones, because it’s even harder for them to do physical distancing and shutdowns."
512,BillGates,"If everything goes well, there might be an effective vaccine in less than 18 months—the fastest a vaccine has ever been developed. That will depend on decisions we make today, including the federal government investing in building up manufacturing capacity."
513,BillGates,"Work is going full speed on potential treatments, and vaccines. But people should know that it will take time to prove they are safe and effective and to start making them."
514,BillGates,"There’s been some progress on more efficient testing methods, such as the self-swab developed by the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network. I hope this and other innovations in testing are scaled up across the country soon. https://t.co/qdrr7Qz16r"
515,BillGates,"The federal government needs to step up on testing: far more tests should be made available, and we should aggregate the results so we can quickly identify potential volunteers for clinical trials and know with confidence when it’s time to return to normal."
516,BillGates,"Extreme physical distancing measures will make a big difference in the U.S., but we need a consistent nationwide approach. Until the case numbers start to go down across America—which could take 10 weeks or more—no one can continue business as usual or relax the shutdown."
