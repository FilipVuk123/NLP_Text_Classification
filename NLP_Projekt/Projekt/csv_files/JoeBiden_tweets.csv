0,JoeBiden,"These kinds of mass shootings rarely happen anywhere else in the world.

Why are we willing to live with this carnage? Where in God's name is our backbone to have the courage to stand up to the gun lobby? 

It is time to turn this pain into action."
1,JoeBiden,"It’s time for those who obstruct or delay, or block the common-sense gun laws, we need to let you know that we will not forget.

We can do so much more. We have to do more."
2,JoeBiden,"To lose a child is to have a piece of your soul ripped away. It is never quite the same.
 
And it’s the feeling shared by the siblings, grandparents, families, and communities left behind.
 
I ask the nation to pray for them, to give them strength in the darkness they feel."
3,JoeBiden,"The Ultra-MAGA Republicans’ proposal puts Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years."
4,JoeBiden,"I proposed a minimum tax for corporations that asks them to pay their fair share in taxes. 

Senator Scott’s plan lets them off scot-free."
5,JoeBiden,Republicans don't want to solve inflation by lowering costs. They want to solve it by raising taxes and lowering your income.
6,JoeBiden,"Under my predecessor, the deficit increased every single year he was president.  

Last year, the deficit was reduced by $350B. And this year, we're on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5T—the biggest decline in debt ever in American history."
7,JoeBiden,"Right now, the average billionaire—there are about 790 of them or so in America—has an average federal tax rate of 8%. 

No billionaire should be paying a lower tax rate than a teacher, a firefighter, an electrician, or a police officer."
8,JoeBiden,"Rebuilding America with union labor is smart for business.  

Why? When union workers are on the job, projects are completed efficiently and professionally, and they ultimately save money."
9,JoeBiden,"Unions allow workers to maintain their dignity. 

It's a lot more than just paychecks and benefits, it's about the dignity of workers."
10,JoeBiden,"We're working to make sure safe baby formula gets to all who need it by:

- Invoking the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production 
- Launching Operation Fly Formula to use federal planes to fly formula in from abroad"
11,JoeBiden,"We cannot remain silent.

12,JoeBiden,"In America, evil will not win, I promise you. Hate will not prevail. And white supremacy will not have the last word."
13,JoeBiden,"Three years ago, I kicked off my campaign for president in Philadelphia. Since then, we've gotten to work making historic infrastructure investments, creating record job growth, and rebuilding our economy.

There's more work ahead of us, but we’re building a better America. https://t.co/lnJkwd84KY"
14,JoeBiden,"We’ve reduced the deficit by $350 billion, and we’re on track to reduce the deficit by $1.5 trillion this fiscal year.

There’s more work to do, but this has never happened before in American history."
15,JoeBiden,Electing @JohnFetterman to the United States Senate would be a big step forward for Pennsylvania’s working people. https://t.co/k5HguGZSTb
16,JoeBiden,"A plan by Republican Senator Rick Scott would increase taxes on 70% of the American public and put Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid on the chopping block every five years.

Under my plan, no one making less than $400,000 will see their taxes increase."
17,JoeBiden,"On the International Day Against Homophobia, Transphobia, and Biphobia, we stand in support and solidarity with LGBTQI+ people in the United States and around the world. 

We stand with you and will continue to defend human rights and dignity."
18,JoeBiden,"When I ran for office, I said I wanted to rebuild the backbone of our economy—the middle class.

Because I believe that everybody does better when everybody is in on the deal. https://t.co/0BTVvg2bde"
19,JoeBiden,"There are a whole range of issues that are susceptible if the leaked opinion on Roe v. Wade ends up being the actual Court opinion. 

It’s not just choice that’s at stake here."
20,JoeBiden,"You want to bring down inflation?

Let’s make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share."
21,JoeBiden,"During my first year in office, American agriculture exports shattered all previous records—$177 billion last year alone.

We have to keep investing in our farmers to reduce prices for consumers."
22,JoeBiden,"Republicans in Congress are so deeply committed to protecting big corporations that they would rather raise taxes on working American families.
https://t.co/1Z0v3YTNyC"
23,JoeBiden,"Republicans love to attack me as a big spender. Let's compare the facts.

Under my predecessor, the deficit exploded, rising every single year. Under my plan, we are on track to cut the federal deficit by $1.5 trillion by the end of the fiscal year."
24,JoeBiden,"Senator Rick Scott’s ultra-MAGA agenda could raise taxes on 75 million American families, over 95% of whom make less than $100,000 a year. 

Their plan is going to make working families poorer.
https://t.co/ARj00d35Zi"
25,JoeBiden,"Once again – as fundamental rights are at risk at the Supreme Court – Senate Republicans have blocked passage of the Women’s Health Protection Act, a bill that affirmatively protects access to reproductive health care."
26,JoeBiden,"High-speed internet is not a luxury any longer. It's a necessity. 

That's why the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law included $65 billion to make sure we expand access to broadband internet in every region of the country—urban, suburban, and rural."

29,JoeBiden,"When I took office, there were around 20 million people relying on unemployment benefits to feed their families; today, that number is around 1 million—the lowest since 1970. 

We are building an economy that values the dignity of work."
30,JoeBiden,"There have been only 3 months in the last 50 years where the unemployment rate in America is lower than it is now. 

This is a direct result of the American Rescue Plan, our COVID vaccination program, and my plan to grow our economy from the bottom up and middle out."
31,JoeBiden,"The Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott of Florida would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average.

My plan would make it easier to start a small business by expanding their access to capital."
32,JoeBiden,"Today, we learned that the economy created 428,000 jobs in April—bringing the total number of jobs created since I took office to 8.3 million.

There's more work to do, but our plans and policies have produced the strongest job creation economy in modern times."
33,JoeBiden,"All the talk about the deficit from my Republican friends—I love it. 

The deficit was reduced by $350 billion in my first year in office, and we are on track to reduce it by another $1.5 trillion."
34,JoeBiden,"My plan to reduce the deficit would help reduce inflationary pressures and lower everyday costs for families.

My plan lets Medicare negotiate the price of prescription drugs. We can cap the price of insulin at $35 instead of the hundreds of dollars for some families."
35,JoeBiden,"While there’s still more work to do, we’re on track to cut the federal deficit by another $1.5 trillion by the end of this fiscal year—the biggest decline in a single year ever in American history."
36,JoeBiden,"Let me tell you about this Ultra-MAGA Agenda.
https://t.co/Cl41pqMEX1"
37,JoeBiden,"Senator Rick Scott released an Ultra-MAGA Agenda.

It could raise taxes on 75 million American families. 

Under this new plan, while big corporations and billionaires would pay nothing more, working-class folks are going to pay a hell of a lot more."
38,JoeBiden,"At the federal level, we will need more pro-choice senators and a pro-choice majority in the House to adopt legislation that codifies Roe, which I will work to pass and sign into law."
39,JoeBiden,"If the Court overturns Roe, it will fall on our nation’s elected officials at all levels of government to protect a woman’s right to choose. 

And it will fall on voters to elect pro-choice officials this November."
40,JoeBiden,"I believe that a woman’s right to choose is fundamental. Roe has been the law of the land for almost fifty years, and basic fairness and the stability of our law demand that it not be overturned.

We will be ready when any ruling is issued."
41,JoeBiden,"As the proud husband of an educator, I've seen firsthand the dedication and selflessness of our nation's educators. 

Teaching isn't what @DrBiden does, it's who she is. On Teacher Appreciation Week, we honor teachers' work to build confidence and inspire curiosity. https://t.co/oyYOyt5cfc"
42,JoeBiden,"Last year, we saw businesses with fewer than 50 workers create 1,900,000 jobs for the first three quarters of 2021 alone. 

While there’s still more work to do, that's the highest rate of small business creation ever recorded in a single year."
43,JoeBiden,"The Republican proposal, led by Senator Rick Scott, would raise taxes on 6.1 million small business owners—including 82% of small business owners who earn less than $50,000 a year. 

That’s just not right."
44,JoeBiden,"The people who made a difference in my life, in a fundamental way, were teachers.

This National Teacher Appreciation Week, we honor their service and passion and celebrate the immeasurable contributions of our nation’s educators in schools from coast to coast."
45,JoeBiden,"I grew up in a family where, when prices went up for things like gasoline, it became a discussion at the kitchen table. We felt it. 

That's why I'm focused on doing everything I can to lower the cost of gas and energy and accelerate our transition to clean energy."
46,JoeBiden,"Just as Putin chose to launch this brutal invasion, he could make the choice to end it. 

Russia is the aggressor, and the world must and will hold Russia accountable."
47,JoeBiden,"Our party is working to ensure that we can expand our Democratic majorities in the years to come—and we need your help to do it. 

Chip in before the end of the month deadline to help elect Democrats up and down the ballot: 
https://t.co/Ivryo0uc4U"
48,JoeBiden,"With the help of the American Rescue Plan, local governments were able to add a record 279,000 new educators in 2021 and nearly 46,000 teaching jobs in the first months of 2022."
49,JoeBiden,"Thanks in large part to the American Rescue Plan, last year, Americans applied to start 5.4 million new businesses—20% more than any other year on record.

The American economy is strong because our small businesses are strong."
50,JoeBiden,"Twelve years later, Republicans still haven't stopped their attacks on the Affordable Care Act. 

If they have their way, 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions could once again be denied health care coverage by their insurance companies."
51,JoeBiden,"The Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott of Florida would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average. https://t.co/2kHWJDrxq3"
52,JoeBiden,"Through decades of organizing, negotiating, picketing, and protesting, labor unions secured vital workplace protections that union and non-union workers rely on today, and we are working to strengthen both unions and the workplace protections they provide."
53,JoeBiden,Not only do Republicans oppose making big corporations pay their fair share—they want middle class families and small business owners to pay more in taxes.
54,JoeBiden,"A stronger economy built from the bottom up and the middle out puts greater power in workers' hands to improve their lives, provide for their families, and choose higher quality, higher-paying, and safer jobs."
55,JoeBiden,"Democrats are working tirelessly to open doors for more outstanding entrepreneurs.

But the Republican plan led by Senator Rick Scott would tax half of our small business owners an extra $1,200 a year on average."
56,JoeBiden,"American workers are beginning to rebuild our nation's roads, bridges, ports, and waterways.

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will create new jobs, modernize communities across the country, and open infrastructure jobs to people of all backgrounds."
57,JoeBiden,This is not your father’s Republican Party. https://t.co/trUWTISdx5
58,JoeBiden,"Ensuring worker safety is a national priority and a moral imperative.

On Workers Memorial Day, we honor and remember those who lost their lives on the job and reaffirm every worker's basic right to a safe and healthy workplace."
59,JoeBiden,"Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re going to start replacing 100% of the lead pipes and water lines that go into homes and schools in this country.

Every American, every child, should be able to turn on a faucet and drink water that’s clean."
60,JoeBiden,"The unemployment rate for veterans is 2.4%—tied for the lowest rate on record. 

There is still more work to do, but this historic progress is the result of rebuilding America’s economy from the bottom up and the middle out."
61,JoeBiden,"Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re investing $25 billion to upgrade and modernize American airports."
62,JoeBiden,"The United States will ban Russian-affiliated ships from our ports.

That means no ship that sails under the Russian flag or that is owned or operated by a Russian interest will be allowed to dock in a United States port or access our shores. None."
63,JoeBiden,"Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re going to plant 1.2 billion trees across the country to begin the vital work of reforesting America. It makes sense and also makes a big difference in our cities and on our city streets."
64,JoeBiden,"On Earth Day, we’re committed to building a future where everyone has clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, and healthy communities to work and live.

By investing in climate resilience and infrastructure, and a clean energy future, we can tackle the climate crisis head-on."
65,JoeBiden,"Putin has failed to achieve his grand ambitions on the battlefield.

President Zelenskyy and his democratically elected government remain in power, and Ukrainian armed forces—joined by brave Ukrainian civilians—have thwarted Russia's conquest of their country."
66,JoeBiden,"Our unity at home and our unity with allies, partners, and the Ukrainian people is sending an unmistakable message to Putin: He will never succeed in dominating and occupying all of Ukraine. That will not happen."
67,JoeBiden,"I’m doing everything I can to bring down prices to address Putin’s Price Hike.  

That’s why I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day on average for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve."
68,JoeBiden,"Thanks to the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we’re making the most significant investment in modernizing our roads and bridges since the Interstate Highway System was built under President Eisenhower."
69,JoeBiden,"Our recovery so far has led to the creation of 7.9 million new jobs—more jobs created over the first 14 months than any president ever. The unemployment rate is at 3.6%, down from 6.4% in January 2021.

We have more work to do, but America is on the move."
70,JoeBiden,"While Congressional Republicans are proposing big tax increases on middle-class families, I am fighting for tax cuts for the middle class and to ensure that the super wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share."
71,JoeBiden,"The difference couldn’t be clearer:

Under the Congressional Republican Tax Plan, 75 million middle-class families’ taxes will increase an average of almost $1,500 a year.

Under my plan, no one making less than $400,000 will have their taxes raised."
72,JoeBiden,"When we build more in America, we increase economic capacity, and ultimately it helps lower everyday prices for families.
https://t.co/hWTyRb4kIL"
73,JoeBiden,"From day one, every action I've taken to rebuild our economy has been guided by one principle—made in America. It means using products, parts, and materials built right here in the United States. It means bringing manufacturing jobs back and building supply chains here at home."
74,JoeBiden,"To help deal with Putin’s Price Hike, I’ve authorized the use of 1 million barrels per day on average for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve—the largest release of our national reserve in history."
75,JoeBiden,"America is back to work. 

Our economy added 7.9 million jobs since I took office—more jobs created on average per month than under any other president in history. That’s millions of families with a little more breathing room and the dignity a job provides."

79,JoeBiden,"Today, we enshrine in law our recognition that the Postal Service is fundamental to our economy, to our democracy, to our health, and the very sense of who we are as a nation."
80,JoeBiden,"If Republicans have their way, up to 100 million Americans with preexisting conditions could once again be denied health care coverage by their insurance companies.

I’ve got a better idea. Instead of destroying the Affordable Care Act, let's keep building on it. https://t.co/jqtoDPgekn"
81,JoeBiden,"Over 31 million people now have health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.
4 out of 5 Americans can find quality coverage for under $10 a month.
The average family is saving $2,400 a year on their premiums.

The Affordable Care Act is stronger now than it has ever been."

87,JoeBiden,"Last year, we reduced the deficit by more than $350 billion. And now under my budget, we’re on track for the largest one-year reduction in the deficit in U.S. history.

89,JoeBiden,"A firefighter and a teacher shouldn’t pay a higher tax rate than a billionaire pays. That’s not right.

My budget contains a Billionaire Minimum Income Tax to make sure billionaires pay their fair share. https://t.co/MkPFrUsAo6"
90,JoeBiden,"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has driven up gas prices and food prices all over the world. 

To help deal with that, yesterday I authorized the release of 1 million barrels per day for the next six months from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve."
91,JoeBiden,"Last week, I met with NATO allies to reiterate our strong support for the Ukrainian people.

Putin was banking on NATO being divided, but it has never been more united than it is today."

93,JoeBiden,"This week, I signed the Emmett Till Antilynching Act into law, making lynching a federal hate crime for the first time in American history.

Just visit https://t.co/n2B6pfyjAt."

101,JoeBiden,My budget makes the investments needed to reduce costs for families and make progress on my Unity Agenda—including investments to cut the costs of child care and health care; help families pay for other essentials; end cancer as we know it; and support our veterans.
102,JoeBiden,My budget would further reduce the deficit by continuing to support the economic growth that has increased revenues and ensuring that billionaires and large corporations pay their fair share.

104,JoeBiden,"A dictator bent on rebuilding an empire will never erase a people's love for liberty. 

Brutality will never grind down the will to be free. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia."
105,JoeBiden,"Rather than breaking Ukrainian resolve, Russia's brutal tactics have strengthened their resolve. Rather than driving NATO apart, the West is now stronger and more united than it's ever been."
106,JoeBiden,"Russia's economy was ranked the 11th biggest economy in the world before this invasion. 

It will soon not even rank among the top 20 in the world."

We will not let autocrats and would-be emperors dictate the direction of the world."

Few pieces of legislation in our history have done more to lift the country out of crisis."
131,JoeBiden,"Putin was counting on a divided NATO, a divided West and quite frankly, a divided America.

It was just the beginning."

It's why our economy has recovered faster than other major global economies."

Let’s make those savings permanent."

—500 million shots in arms

And I’m pressing Congress to pass my plan to lower the cost of essentials like prescription drugs and energy."
141,JoeBiden,"With all the bright spots in our economy—record job growth and higher wages—too many families are struggling to keep up with the bills. Inflation is robbing them of the gains they might otherwise feel. 
 
I get it. That’s why my top priority is getting prices under control."
142,JoeBiden,"A large contributor to inflation this month was an increase in gas and energy prices as markets reacted to Putin’s aggressive actions. 

I know that higher prices impact a family’s budget, which is why I am fighting to bring down the everyday prices that are squeezing Americans."

1722,JoeBiden,"In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare.

1723,JoeBiden,The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.

Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K"
1726,JoeBiden,"When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus.

As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and we’ll ban them once again."
1852,JoeBiden,"This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice.

1865,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.

1873,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it.

1874,JoeBiden,You deserve a president who tells you the truth.
1875,JoeBiden,"If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone.

As we mark the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, let’s make sure we don’t wait another 100 years to fulfill that founding promise."
2111,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump still doesn’t have a plan to get this virus under control. His failure to lead is costing American lives.

2112,JoeBiden,"A good step forward. Yet President Trump continues to do everything he can to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.

2116,JoeBiden,"""A president's words have the power to move markets. They can start wars or broker peace. They can summon our better angels or awaken our worst instincts. You simply cannot fake your way through this job.""

2121,JoeBiden,"If we want to build back better and deliver real change for the American people, then we've got to flip the U.S. Senate. And the path to doing so runs right through Maine. Thank you, @SaraGideon for being with us tonight. #DemConvention https://t.co/1eyIpC81vC"

2133,JoeBiden,"Secretary Esper and President Trump, it's a president's job to protect the health and safety of our troops and their families. Gutting the military health care system — no less during a global pandemic — is unacceptable. https://t.co/lXpcSdm8au"

2136,JoeBiden,"The hard truth is that our economy wasn't working for folks long before this crisis. It's why we can't just go back to the way things were — we have to build back better. 

We've got to create an economy that works for everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected."
2137,JoeBiden,"As Attorney General of the largest state in the country, @KamalaHarris took on the big banks over mortgage fraud, and Big Oil when they wanted to pollute without consequences.

She's the kind of fighter I need alongside me in the White House."
2138,JoeBiden,"Here’s my promise to you: If I’m elected president, I will always choose to unite rather than divide. 

I’ll take responsibility instead of blaming others.

She's ready to hit the ground running on day one."
2143,JoeBiden,We need nationwide mask mandates.
2144,JoeBiden,"Mr. President, Jill and I are sad to learn of your younger brother Robert’s passing. I know the tremendous pain of losing a loved one — and I know how important family is in moments like these. I hope you know that our prayers are with you all."
2145,JoeBiden,We can meet the challenge of COVID-19 and turn the corner on this pandemic. We just need a president and vice president ready and willing to lead. https://t.co/HqfHD0qB4y

2147,JoeBiden,"William Perry Pendley has no business working at @blmnational and I'm happy to see his nomination to lead it withdrawn. In a Biden Administration, folks who spend their careers selling off public lands won't get anywhere near being tapped to protect them. https://t.co/a0GsuoCVpn"

2150,JoeBiden,"Come January, there won’t be any time to waste repairing the damage of the last four years and beginning the work of building back better.

@KamalaHarris and I are ready to get to work on day one. https://t.co/xEkEVwTHs6"
2151,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump has had a lot of failures in his career, but he knows how to do one thing well: inherit something great and squander it. And never take any responsibility. https://t.co/mDTSFogeUW"
2152,JoeBiden,.@KamalaHarris' story is America's story. https://t.co/y871XVZlLX
2153,JoeBiden,We’ve got to protect and expand Social Security — I’ll get it done as President. https://t.co/hnkhh6I1ar

2156,JoeBiden,"The fate of Social Security is on the ballot in November. As President, I will never, ever defund Social Security. I’ll strengthen it.

2157,JoeBiden,"People are losing their homes. Millions have already lost their paychecks. Our country is in crisis.

The virus isn’t taking a break — Republicans shouldn’t either. The House did their job. President Trump, bring the Senate back and pass a relief bill. Now."
2158,JoeBiden,What kind of president tries to defund Social Security during an economic crisis? https://t.co/FO47IjABTF
2159,JoeBiden,"Voting by mail is safe and secure. And don't take my word for it:
Take it from the President, who just requested his mail-in ballot for the Florida primary on Tuesday."

Chip in today to help us win in November: https://t.co/k2hF0doNMG"
2165,JoeBiden,"The hard truth is Black women still only get paid 62 cents for every dollar white men make. It's unacceptable.

My administration will work to close the pay gap for Black women and create an economy where everyone gets a fair return for their work. #BlackWomensEqualPayDay https://t.co/UTADOjULxF"
2166,JoeBiden,I know @KamalaHarris will work every single day to make life better for all Americans and build this nation back better than before. https://t.co/8hTslszBPC
2167,JoeBiden,"I first met @KamalaHarris through my son Beau. They grew close while fighting to take on the big banks — and he had enormous respect for her and her work.

There is no one’s opinion I valued more than Beau’s, and I’m proud to have Kamala standing with me on this campaign."
2168,JoeBiden,.@DrBiden and I are keeping the people of Iowa and everyone impacted by Monday's derecho in our prayers. We've got to make sure Iowans and those across the midwest get the relief they need for a quick and full recovery. https://t.co/nsPQUKDbp2
2169,JoeBiden,"When I was making my decision, I knew I needed someone who’s ready to help lead the nation on day one.

@KamalaHarris is that person. https://t.co/7PZUupy8Dm"
2170,JoeBiden,"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation. And if we're going to get through these crises — we need to come together and unite for a better America.

@KamalaHarris gets that — and I believe there's no better person to help me get the job done."
2171,JoeBiden,"When I called @KamalaHarris yesterday to ask her to be my running mate, I wanted to make sure Jill and Doug got to say hello. 

You’re honorary Bidens now! https://t.co/IILUjB6WfY"
2172,JoeBiden,"Three years ago today, white supremacists descended on Charlottesville with torches in hand and hate in their hearts. Our president said they were ""very fine people.""
 
It was clear then, and it's clear now: We are in a battle for the soul of our nation, and we must win."
2173,JoeBiden,"Let's get to work, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/EjtUpgaieI"
2174,JoeBiden,One of the reasons I chose @KamalaHarris is because we both believe you can define America in one simple word — possibilities.
2175,JoeBiden,"If you’re worried about whether you’ll have a job, worried about the poisons in the air you breathe and water you drink, worried about your civil rights or even your basic dignity being under attack—@KamalaHarris has had your back. Now, we have to have hers."
2176,JoeBiden,"Working families need someone on their side...because they certainly don’t have anyone on their side with this president.
 
That’s going to change in the Biden-Harris administration."
2177,JoeBiden,"This morning, little girls woke up across this nation — especially Black and Brown girls who so often may feel overlooked and undervalued in our society — potentially seeing themselves in a new way: As the stuff of Presidents and Vice Presidents."
2178,JoeBiden,"We’ve all watched @KamalaHarris in the Senate go toe-to-toe with Trump officials trying to hide the truth, asking the tough questions that need to be asked — and not stopping until she gets an answer. She’s ready to do this job."
2179,JoeBiden,"This afternoon, @KamalaHarris and I will be speaking together for the first time since yesterday’s big announcement. Tune in: https://t.co/xoRbSqGta8"
2180,JoeBiden,"Whether it's taking on the big banks or pushing for marriage equality—Kamala never shies away from fighting tooth and nail for what's right. It's why I chose her to be my running mate.

She'll wake up every day thinking about how to make life better for the people of our country."
2181,JoeBiden,"As the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, @KamalaHarris grew up believing in the promise of America because she saw it firsthand.

Together, Kamala and I are going to fight every single day in the White House to make sure that promise is fulfilled for all Americans."
2182,JoeBiden,"If @KamalaHarris and I are elected, we’re going to inherit multiple crises, a nation divided, and a world in disarray. We won’t have a minute to waste.
 
That's exactly why I picked her: She's ready to lead on day one."
2183,JoeBiden,".@KamalaHarris is the daughter of proud immigrants—a mother from India and a father from Jamaica—who raised her to take action.
That’s exactly what this moment calls for: action. And we hope you’ll take action with us: https://t.co/K3mVwfTxXJ https://t.co/MZLAx9IN6C"
2184,JoeBiden,"Right now, America faces: 
 
- The worst pandemic in 100 years
- The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression
- The most powerful calls for racial justice in a generation
 
I need someone alongside me who's smart, tough, and ready to lead. @KamalaHarris is that person."
2185,JoeBiden,"Thanks to supporters like you, we are on track to have our biggest fundraising day ever. Together, we can win this.

Join us. https://t.co/B7uyMcat6n"
2186,JoeBiden,"Let’s go win this, @KamalaHarris. https://t.co/O2EYo6rYyk"
2187,JoeBiden,"I have the great honor to announce that I’ve picked @KamalaHarris — a fearless fighter for the little guy, and one of the country’s finest public servants — as my running mate."
2188,JoeBiden,"Don't forget that in the middle of this pandemic, the Trump Administration is in court trying to eliminate Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's heartless.

I'll protect and build on the ACA to ensure everyone gets the care they need. https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h"
2189,JoeBiden,"I promise you if I'm elected, I won't waste any time getting this virus under control.

I'll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. I'll bring together top experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward.

We'll get it done, together."
2190,JoeBiden,"This is the latest dire consequence of Donald Trump looking the other way on Beijing's repression in Hong Kong. Instead of standing for freedom and democracy, he consistently stands with Xi Jinping.

I'll put American values back at the center of our foreign policy. https://t.co/3RAZOeVtHr"
2191,JoeBiden,Social Security is the bedrock of American retirement — giving countless Americans peace of mind and the ability to retire with dignity. I've been fighting to protect and expand the program throughout my career — and I'll continue that fight as president.
2192,JoeBiden,"Folks, we need to listen to our frontline heroes. Wear a mask. It’s not just about you. It’s about keeping your family, neighbors, and fellow citizens safe. https://t.co/pbI6UVhqvh"
2193,JoeBiden,Bristol Bay is no place for a mine — our administration decided that in 2014. We're only discussing it today because Donald Trump's EPA reversed course hours after a closed-door meeting with the mining company's CEO. https://t.co/RG38v0dRDk
2194,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump said that if he’s re-elected, he’ll defund Social Security.

We can't let that happen."
2195,JoeBiden,"President Trump keeps attacking the U.S. Postal Service, and now hundreds of thousands of veterans aren't getting their life-saving medications on time. It's despicable.

I promise you that as president, I will never put politics over the care of our nation's veterans. https://t.co/aXryhxVRtG"
2196,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump’s surrender to the pandemic has led to a resurgence of the virus and more economic pain and anxiety for millions of Americans. 

After six months of a nation in crisis, he still has no plan to get us through. But I do: https://t.co/SOVOPL7uPy"
2197,JoeBiden,"To the millions of Americans struggling to get by right now — those who can't find a job or pay the bills: I want you to know that I see you, and I won't forget you — and I'm going to fight every day in the White House to build an economy that works for you."
2198,JoeBiden,Every single eligible American should have the opportunity to vote-by-mail this November. If it's good enough for Donald Trump — then it's good enough for you and me.
2199,JoeBiden,We can’t let Donald Trump destroy the U.S. Postal Service.
2200,JoeBiden,It's been six years since Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson — reigniting a movement. We must continue the work of tackling systemic racism and reforming policing.
2201,JoeBiden,Our planet can’t take four more years of Donald Trump. We have to get him out of the White House so we can start treating the climate crisis like the urgent threat it is.
2202,JoeBiden,"Giving the Trump administration another four years in office would have catastrophic implications for future generations. His victory would threaten the future of our democracy, and we must vote him out this November. https://t.co/iIFPTIB1Er"
2203,JoeBiden,"The United States just passed 5 million reported infections of COVID-19. It’s a number that boggles the mind and breaks the heart. Each time the number goes up, it represents a life altered, a family stricken with anxiety, a community on edge. It shouldn’t have gotten this bad."
2204,JoeBiden,"Today, Donald Trump stated that if re-elected, he'll undermine the entire financial footing of Social Security.

Our seniors and millions of Americans with disabilities are under enough stress without their hard-earned Social Security benefits in doubt. https://t.co/glUDQlcbEO"
2205,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump has refused to take serious action to combat the COVID-19 crisis. And as a result, he got what he’s always wanted — the U.S. isolated from the rest of the world. https://t.co/owvNL4ul74"
2206,JoeBiden,"It’s an important choice, and I want you to be one of the first to know who I’ve picked as my running mate – text FIRST to 30330 to get notified when I’ve made my decision."
2207,JoeBiden,"Between the coronavirus and the economic crisis, this is a tough time for our country, I know. But I firmly believe that our best days still lie ahead. Together, we will climb out of these crises and emerge stronger than before."
2208,JoeBiden,"The fact is, Donald Trump left our nation unprepared and unprotected for the worst public health crisis of our lifetime — and we're paying the price every single day. https://t.co/sZJCdivRo3"
2209,JoeBiden,"Our nation is desperate for leadership — leadership that can unite us and steer us through these crises. But at the most critical moment of his presidency, Donald Trump has nothing to offer."
2210,JoeBiden,"No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I'll promise you this: when I'm President we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better."
2211,JoeBiden,"John Lewis will be remembered as a moral giant who dedicated his life to creating a more just, equal, and moral America.

Donald Trump will not. https://t.co/vfZFeCUX3S"

2213,JoeBiden,"I believe every American deserves a fair shot at success — not just the Mar-a-Lago crowd. That’s why as president, I’ll reverse Donald Trump’s giant tax giveaways to the super-wealthy and big corporations, and build an economy that works for everyone."
2214,JoeBiden,It didn't have to be this bad. https://t.co/xwdxgizLLH
2215,JoeBiden,"Here’s the truth—Donald Trump turned his back on the middle class long before COVID-19. He cut taxes for the super-wealthy, drove U.S. manufacturing into a recession, and stacked the deck against hardworking Americans.

It's time we pick a different path. https://t.co/rt5RD9WOGA"
2216,JoeBiden,Make no mistake: This economic crisis is due to President Trump’s failure to get this virus under control. https://t.co/CBbk6SV39Q
2217,JoeBiden,"While I am grateful for the people who got their jobs back, my heart goes out to the more than 16 million Americans still out of work. The truth is it didn't have to be this bad, but Donald Trump failed to act. He's the one person who should lose his job. https://t.co/eIHGRjwJd3"
2218,JoeBiden,President Trump called Arizona “a model for applying a science-based approach to the decreasing cases and hospitalizations without implementing a punishing lockdown.” He said Governor Ducey’s approach should be used by other states—but here’s what’s really happening in Arizona:
2219,JoeBiden,"Earlier today, I made some comments about diversity in the African American and Latino communities that I want to clarify. In no way did I mean to suggest the African American community is a monolith—not by identity, not on issues, not at all."
2220,JoeBiden,"I believe that the right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. To protect it, we’ve got to:

- Pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act
- Enact automatic and same-day voter registration
- Stand up to Republican voter suppression efforts"

2222,JoeBiden,"Every moment with your loved ones is precious. I know that in my core because I’ve learned it through loss. It's why as president, I'm going to do everything I can to get this virus under control and get our lives back to normal as soon as we can. https://t.co/qCsvryHMai"
2223,JoeBiden,Let me be clear: Voting is a right — not a privilege. Anyone who tells you otherwise can’t be trusted to hold the highest office in this land.
2224,JoeBiden,"The fight for civil rights is what drove me to get involved in politics in the first place. It's why I fought for and helped secure a 25-year extension of the Voting Rights Act. And it's why as president, I'll immediately sign the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act into law. https://t.co/fHqUvYahRR"
2225,JoeBiden,"55 years ago today, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law — bringing us one step closer to that more perfect union. As we mark its anniversary, we’ve got to continue our fight to restore the VRA and protect the sacred right to vote."
2226,JoeBiden,The scenes of death and destruction from Hiroshima and Nagasaki still horrify us 75 years later. They reach through history to remind us of the hideous damage nuclear weapons can inflict—and our collective responsibility to ensure they're never again used. https://t.co/357jRzBPeL

2230,JoeBiden,"Folks, a lot of you have been asking when I’m announcing my running mate, and I promise I’ll let you know soon. But here’s what I can tell you right now: I’m going to tell my supporters first — so text FIRST to 30330 to be the first to know."
2231,JoeBiden,"I don’t buy for one second that the vitality of American manufacturing is a thing of the past. As president, I'll make bold investments in American manufacturing, industry, and innovation to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America. https://t.co/LkIi8g6M5i"
2232,JoeBiden,There's been a lot of talk about my vetting process lately. Here’s an inside look: https://t.co/tFRKJOE3hi
2233,JoeBiden,"Weapons of war have no place in our communities. When I was a senator, I took on the @NRA and secured a 10-year ban on assault weapons — and as president, I’ll ban these weapons again. https://t.co/ggqSaj40EJ"
2234,JoeBiden,"Eight years ago, a white supremacist targeted a Sikh temple in Oak Creek, WI — ultimately taking seven lives in an unspeakable act of terror. To truly honor those we lost, it's up to all of us to stand up to bigotry in our lives, give hate no safe harbor, and reduce gun violence."

That charge feels more important than ever. This is our fight — and together, we will win. https://t.co/eX2xD0jhjX"
2253,JoeBiden,"This is a moment to summon the purpose we felt one year ago after El Paso. A moment to recommit to the battle for the soul of this nation. A battle against white supremacy, hatred, and gun violence.

It won't be easy — but it's a battle we must win."
2254,JoeBiden,"One year ago, a white supremacist armed with a semi-automatic rifle targeted the people of El Paso. He thought his hatred of Latinos and immigrants would prove more powerful than the culture and vibrancy of the community.

Donald Trump fails the basic threshold test of being president: the duty to care about the entire country, not just his re-election prospects."

2493,JoeBiden,"On the final day of #PrideMonth, here’s my promise to you: If I have the honor of being elected, I will be the most pro-equality president in our nation’s history. LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and we can't rest until everyone is treated with dignity and respect under the law."
2494,JoeBiden,"We’re facing a serious threat — and we need to meet it together as one country. But this President gives us no direction and actively pits us against one another.

We can't continue on like this. https://t.co/LA8OJ86Nnk"
2495,JoeBiden,"If I’m elected, I’ll immediately reach out to Dr. Fauci and ask him to continue his incredible service to our country. 

I’ll have the nation’s top medical experts and scientists ready to advise our response on day one — and I'll actually listen to them."
2496,JoeBiden,"Mr. President, the American people didn’t make enormous sacrifices over the past four months so you could waste your time with late night rants and tweets.

We are going to get through this — together."
2499,JoeBiden,"As simple as it sounds, we need a president who listens. So much of this could have been prevented if Donald Trump listened to someone other than himself."

2503,JoeBiden,"Today's decision reaffirmed that states can't put in place laws that unduly burden a woman's right to make her own health care decisions—but the fight isn't over. As President, I'll codify Roe v. Wade and protect a woman’s constitutional right to choose. 
https://t.co/qFrH8hFst8"

We are everything that Donald Trump is not."
2505,JoeBiden,"William Perry Pendley spent his career fighting to sell off public lands — and to allow drilling, mining, and logging on them with hardly any oversight. 

Now the President has nominated him to oversee them at @BLMNational. Consider me opposed. https://t.co/jwlQGs68kO"

2509,JoeBiden,"51 years ago today, a movement was born on Christopher Street. As we remember the anniversary of the Stonewall Uprising and the brave individuals who changed our world forever, let's recommit to finishing the job and finally achieving full LGBTQ+ equality. #Pride https://t.co/PzbGOMy0zx"
2510,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump's entire presidency has been a gift to Putin, but this is beyond the pale. It’s a betrayal of the most sacred duty we bear as a nation, to protect and equip our troops when we send them into harm’s way. https://t.co/r6DCWowxc4"
2511,JoeBiden,"Today the President shared a video of people shouting “white power” and said they were “great.” Just like he did after Charlottesville. 

We’re in a battle for the soul of the nation — and the President has picked a side. But make no mistake: it’s a battle we will win."

2516,JoeBiden,"If Donald Trump prevails in the U.S. Supreme Court, insurers could strip away your health insurance coverage or jack up premiums — simply because you experience long-term effects after battling the coronavirus.

2523,JoeBiden,"Last week, President Trump claimed the virus would ""fade away.""

Donald Trump has failed our nation every step of the way. https://t.co/k5CCKcJzjZ"
2528,JoeBiden,"While President Trump continues his victory lap, over 20 million Americans remain out of work. He may have forgotten about you, but I never will — and I'll fight for you every single day in the White House. https://t.co/cuBH5ufI2f"

2530,JoeBiden,"Health care workers are selflessly risking their lives every day on the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 — and hundreds have paid the ultimate price.

They are American heroes — and we cannot forget the sacrifices they made to care for us all. https://t.co/JBlSo0mYdb"
2531,JoeBiden,"Democracy is under threat globally. Restoring the soul of America means fixing democracy at home, and confronting — not cozying up to — dictators around the world. When I'm president, America will defend democracy at home and abroad. https://t.co/3L6gqvXgI7"
2532,JoeBiden,Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few.

2539,JoeBiden,"Instead of passing police reform or helping hardworking Americans get through this crisis, Republicans are jamming through another one of Trump’s unqualified nominees. It's wrong.

2540,JoeBiden,"We need a president who will expand access to quality, affordable health care — not rip it away."

2544,JoeBiden,It's clear Donald Trump will stop at nothing to tear down Obamacare and rip health care away from millions. We cannot let him get away with it. We have to build on the ACA with a new public option to ensure everyone receives the care they deserve. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C
2545,JoeBiden,"It's pretty simple: If we want to save people's jobs and save people's lives, we need more testing — and we need it faster. The President is intentionally slowing it down. https://t.co/bu1oq1TwzL"
2546,JoeBiden,This is yet another attempt to distract from this Administration's failure to lead an effective response to COVID-19. Immigrants help grow our economy and create jobs. The President can't scapegoat his way out of this crisis. https://t.co/FEqWNJG6TK
2547,JoeBiden,"It's worth repeating that this weekend, President Trump admitted he directed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in the middle of a global pandemic.

2555,JoeBiden,"Trump opposed sanctioning China’s government over its atrocious human rights violations to protect his hollow trade deal and serve his own personal interests.

2556,JoeBiden,"My dad instilled a lot in me, but perhaps most important is the belief that there’s no higher calling than to be a good parent. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads working to help raise their children — and all our children — to be honorable, generous, and kind. https://t.co/Lsm7AkABTn"
2557,JoeBiden,"I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing — not slowing it down. https://t.co/zuZh7DiQ9X"
2558,JoeBiden,"It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress. If we stand together, as one America, we'll rise stronger than before. https://t.co/buzkmkM1Gf"
2559,JoeBiden,Speed up the testing.
2560,JoeBiden,I've found that the way to overcome enormous tragedy in your life is to turn that grief and pain into purpose. Christian Cooper and I discussed how we can take our collective pain in this moment and turn it into a catalyst for change: https://t.co/uPtszYLXxN
2561,JoeBiden,"This nation has always strived to serve as a beacon of hope, but Trump has made it clear that he does not believe our country should be a place of refuge. 

As president, I'll recommit to building a more inclusive and welcoming America. #WorldRefugeeDay 

https://t.co/akD4aANCia"
2562,JoeBiden,Folks credit me for speaking out on marriage equality in 2012 — but I'm not the one who took a real risk. Countless others did the hard work and paid a price just for being themselves. Christian Cooper and I discussed the trailblazers who came before us and the work that remains: https://t.co/bEPmsRgZDo
2563,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump is so eager to get back to his campaign rallies that he’s willing to put people at risk and violate CDC guidelines — as long as they sign a waiver promising not to hold his campaign liable.

Unbelievable."
2564,JoeBiden,"The Tulsa Race Massacre is one of the worst incidents of racial violence in our history — and it has been erased from our national consciousness for far too long.

It’s time we reckon with what happened in 1921. https://t.co/wYX3Adq3vN"
2565,JoeBiden,"Christian Cooper’s encounter in Central Park was another wake-up call for our nation and a reminder of the work that remains to root out hate and intolerance. I'm grateful for Christian's support and know with folks like him leading the way, we'll get the job done. https://t.co/XWhcTjbo0t"
2566,JoeBiden,"We're months into this pandemic and still don't have proper testing, PPE, or clear nationwide guidance. Instead, Donald Trump:

- Pushes dangerous, disproven drugs
- Stands in the way of the CDC
- Refuses to wear a mask

He is failing even the most basic test of leadership."
2567,JoeBiden,"I know it can be hard to keep faith that we will ever achieve that more perfect union we strive to be. But ours is a union worth fighting for — and we are all called to the cause.

None of us can turn away. None of us can stay silent."
2568,JoeBiden,Donald Trump’s failure to fight the coronavirus with the same energy and focus that he uses to troll his enemies on Twitter has cost us lives — and is putting hope for an economic recovery at risk.
2569,JoeBiden,"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important — who we want to be. It’s all at stake.

That's the case we're making in our first TV ad of the general election: https://t.co/gGeSmBIIxA"
2570,JoeBiden,"On June 19, 1865, in Galveston, TX, the last enslaved African Americans were finally given notice of their freedom. 155 years later, we're still on the long road to equality, equity, and fairness for all.

We can't rest until the promise of this nation is fulfilled. #Juneteenth https://t.co/ZHOH8Hz57H"
2571,JoeBiden,"#Juneteenth reminds us of how vulnerable our nation is to being poisoned by systems and acts of inhumanity—but it's also a reminder of our ability to change. Together, we can lay the roots of real and lasting justice, and become the extraordinary nation that was promised to all."
2572,JoeBiden,"Amy — from the moment you announced you were running for president in a snowstorm, it wasn't hard to see you had the grit and determination to do anything you set your mind to. You know how to get things done. With your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump. https://t.co/4kquPZtSV9"
2573,JoeBiden,To all the Dreamers who make our country better and stronger every single day: Thank you. This country needs you. #HomeIsHere https://t.co/VZPVqY1cgq
2574,JoeBiden,"The decisions of the last few days should remind us all of the immense power of the Supreme Court — and the generational impact its justices can have.

We have the power to shape the Court's future this November — and we can’t forget that."
2575,JoeBiden,"I'm ready on day one. After more than three years in office, why isn't Donald Trump ready? https://t.co/ksgxTsG7QK"
2576,JoeBiden,Dreamers are Americans. Period.

2578,JoeBiden,"Here’s my promise to you: On day one, I’ll send a bill to Congress that creates a clear roadmap to citizenship for Dreamers and 11 million undocumented people who are already strengthening our nation. It’s long overdue."
2579,JoeBiden,"It didn’t have to be this bad. But we have a president who is more interested in taking a victory lap than he is in doing the work needed to solve this crisis.

We need a president who will put the American people first — and actually do the work. https://t.co/Lk1GDmSmAM"
2580,JoeBiden,"Thanks, Barack. You're right — and we won't stop until every Dreamer feels safe in this country. https://t.co/fVoZRhabRy"

2582,JoeBiden,"The Supreme Court’s ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. And as President, I will get to work immediately to make it permanent. https://t.co/xKkCp4P9Ff"
2583,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump wants to style himself a wartime president against an invisible enemy — but he has surrendered the fight.

Instead of leading the charge to defeat this virus, he has waved the white flag and retreated."
2584,JoeBiden,"Vice President Pence claimed success because COVID-19 deaths are “down to” fewer than 750 a day.

That's more than 20,000 a month — and they're self-congratulating? Unbelievable.

It may be good enough for President Trump, but it will never be acceptable if I am President. https://t.co/9h08nxjC6k"
2585,JoeBiden,I’m proud to stand with folks across the country participating in today’s #WorkersFirst Caravan. Senate Republicans need to pass the #HeroesAct now and take action to root out systemic racism. https://t.co/s5zCJBXYIp
2586,JoeBiden,"If John Bolton's accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values."
2587,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and failed to take the action necessary to contain it — and now in many states, COVID cases are on the rise again.

This president has failed to lead our nation. https://t.co/1fdu8WMeN5"
2588,JoeBiden,"Five years ago, nine good souls were ripped from this world — killed by hate and white supremacy. Today, we honor the memory of the Emanuel Nine and the unspeakable grace of those they left behind. https://t.co/zpVG2ak8aK"
2589,JoeBiden,"I'm in Darby, Pennsylvania, to discuss how we can make sure the country's reopening is safe, effective, and gets Americans back to work. Tune in: https://t.co/VaCPc32w9A"
2590,JoeBiden,"The truth of our nation is that too often the color of your skin alone can endanger your life and, for far too long, systemic racism has oppressed communities of color in the United States.

It has to change."
2591,JoeBiden,We need a president who chooses unity over division.
2592,JoeBiden,"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: Donald Trump is running the most corrupt administration in modern American history. https://t.co/6Uxn50HzH9"
2593,JoeBiden,"We have the power to write the future we want for this country. One where health care is a right, we lead the world in the fight against climate change, we end our gun violence epidemic, and our government works for all — not just the powerful.

Let’s do it together."
2594,JoeBiden,"We can’t forget that in the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is trying to gut Obamacare and rip health insurance away from millions. It's morally reprehensible."
2595,JoeBiden,"Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement — and we have to do the hard work to root it out. In January, I sat down with Jake, a field organizer on our campaign, to listen to what he had to say and discuss how we can move forward: https://t.co/mVkxpWxbod"

Chip in now to get your ticket: https://t.co/UD3RHHKIw1"
2599,JoeBiden,"Dreamers are Americans. But Trump's ripped away the hard-won protections of DACA recipients, throwing their lives into upheaval. It’s unacceptable, and on day one of my presidency I will protect them from deportation and send a bill to Congress. https://t.co/YlvFuCaTrZ"
2600,JoeBiden,"I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

2603,JoeBiden,"Race-neutral policies are not a sufficient response to race-based disparities. We need to tackle systemic racism head-on and ensure everyone has a fair shot at the American dream.

Here’s what I would do as president: https://t.co/Ni1rAm8DNZ"
2604,JoeBiden,Today's decision is another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect. But we're not done. https://t.co/Bz4SMA9tgb
2605,JoeBiden,"After reports of wealthy Trump donors getting millions in relief meant for small businesses, the administration is now refusing to disclose where the PPP money went. It's unacceptable.

The American people deserve answers. https://t.co/F2n3PA7RZU"
2606,JoeBiden,"In every corner of the country, people are raising their voices and demanding justice. It gives me so much hope.

Together, we’re going to transform this nation and ensure justice finally rings out for all."
2607,JoeBiden,"We need a president who heals — not one who fans the flames of hate.

We can do it, together."
2613,JoeBiden,"Here's my promise to you: I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued our nation — not use them for political gain.

2614,JoeBiden,We need a national ban on chokeholds. Now.
2615,JoeBiden,"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. That is truer today than ever. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will fundamentally alter the character of this nation.
 
We can’t let that happen."
2616,JoeBiden,"In light of Donald Trump's inhumane reversal of protections for transgender people, I want to share a conversation I had a few weeks ago. Adi deserves to be treated with the same respect and dignity as anyone else. Period. https://t.co/nr1u0vOvog"

2618,JoeBiden,"Two years after Trump's Singapore meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, the U.S. and our allies are less safe and Kim's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles keeps growing.

2619,JoeBiden,"Medgar Evers once said, ""freedom has never been free."" On this day in 1963, he paid the ultimate price in pursuit of freedom for his brothers and sisters. He was gunned down fighting to end racial injustice. We must honor him by carrying forward that cause in our own lives today."
2620,JoeBiden,"Four years ago today, 49 lives were cut short in an act of unspeakable terrorism at Pulse nightclub. As we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ+ and Hispanic communities — we have to double down on our efforts to #HonorThemWithAction. https://t.co/TKaZ4M7IFF"

2624,JoeBiden,We need a president who chooses hope over fear.
2625,JoeBiden,We can't let history repeat itself — Facebook needs to act now to stop the spread of disinformation and protect our elections. Watch my deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield break down what's happening and how you can help us fix it: https://t.co/WYMMAWkuLZ https://t.co/OGG2wwtW2P
2626,JoeBiden,"COVID-19 can affect anyone, anywhere — but it doesn't impact every community equally. Watch as Dr. Ebony Jade Hilton explains how it’s impacting communities of color: https://t.co/3uuXEsfyv4"
2627,JoeBiden,"While the president was spiking the football and taking a victory lap, another 1.5 million Americans filed new unemployment claims last week.
 
He is completely oblivious to what's really happening in this country — and hardworking Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/AglBowCtKc"
2628,JoeBiden,"We have to ensure our economic reopening is safe and strong — and builds the foundation for an economy that works for everyone. Today, I'm releasing my plan to make that happen: https://t.co/v6hImc0J3q"

2631,JoeBiden,"Folks, we saw in 2016 what can happen when social media platforms are left unchecked and allow disinformation to run rampant. It puts the very integrity of our elections at risk.
 
We simply cannot let it happen again in 2020."
2632,JoeBiden,It's in our darkest moments that we've produced some of our greatest progress — and we have that opportunity once again. Let's make this a moment of action to address systemic racism and propel our nation into an era of true equality and opportunity.

2637,JoeBiden,"Nothing about the fights we're facing will be easy. Racism has been a fixture in our society for hundreds of years. 
 
But I’m ready to get to work on day one. We can’t accept anything less from an American president."
2638,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump’s hate-filled, conspiracy-laden rhetoric is inflaming the racial divides in our country—but just fixing the way the president talks won’t cut it. We need to root out systemic racism and ensure Black Americans have a real shot to get ahead. https://t.co/FhgRNPjKR8"
2639,JoeBiden,"America was founded on the promise of equality, liberty, and justice for all. We’ve never fully lived up to that promise — and we can’t rest until we finally do."
2640,JoeBiden,From ballot shortages and issues with machines to hours-long lines — what happened today in Georgia should enrage us all. We need to act now to prevent it from happening again in November. Our democracy depends on it. https://t.co/LLhBr8qVQw
2641,JoeBiden,"Because of Donald Trump's negligence and incompetence:
 
- More than 110,000 people have died
- We have nearly 2 million cases of COVID-19
- Over 20 million Americans are out of work
 
And yet he’s patting himself on the back. Unbelievable."

2643,JoeBiden,"Let me be clear: We can't leave this moment and once again turn away and do nothing.
 
We need justice. We need action. We need reform."
2644,JoeBiden,"Grief is a heavy burden to bear — and it's even harder with the eyes of the world watching. I know. But that burden is now a purpose — to change the world for the better in the name of George Floyd.

That's the message I shared with his loved ones during today's service: https://t.co/2LKJzwBUSO"
2645,JoeBiden,"My Dad used to say there's no greater sin than the abuse of power.

Whether it's an officer bloodying a peaceful protester or a President defending him with a conspiracy theory he saw on TV.

I'm a Catholic – just like Martin. Our faith says that we can't accept either."
2646,JoeBiden,"Together, let’s make this an era of action. https://t.co/JHt3sELUCV"
2647,JoeBiden,"This moment is a wake-up call for all of us. It's long past time we deal with systemic racism, growing economic inequality, and the denial of the promise of this nation to so many. https://t.co/IV4EVWAfRO"

2652,JoeBiden,"We're facing some of the greatest challenges in our history, and Donald Trump is patting himself on the back. He just has no idea what’s really going on in this country.
 
It's time for him to step out of his bunker and look around at the consequences of his words and actions."
2653,JoeBiden,"American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending. But we have the power to write the future we want for this nation.

Don't let anyone tell you differently."
2654,JoeBiden,Donald Trump is the worst possible person to lead us through this moment.
2655,JoeBiden,Our nation is at an inflection point. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics — or we can take the next great step forward. https://t.co/AbLAYAUsZx
2656,JoeBiden,These disparities have plagued our nation for far too long. It’s time we rebuild our country upon more just and equal foundations — and finally close race-based wealth and income gaps. https://t.co/KforFaypAP

2659,JoeBiden,"The words of a president matter. And time and time again, Donald Trump has callously used his to incite violence, stoke the flames of hatred and division, and drive us further apart.
 
We cannot give him another four years in the White House."
2660,JoeBiden,"We need to stand up as a nation — with the Black community and with all minority communities — and come together as one America. Because the pain is too immense for one community to bear alone.
 
It is the duty of every American to grapple with it — and grapple with it now."
2661,JoeBiden,"I promised George Floyd's family that he wouldn’t just become another hashtag — and I intend to keep that promise.
 
We need justice. And we need real police reform to ensure this never occurs again."
2662,JoeBiden,"To all those families who are scared, and hurting, and wondering what’s going to happen next: I want you to know I see you. I won’t ever forget you. And I won’t be satisfied until this economy starts working for all of you. https://t.co/YxQ2OaeSyQ"
2663,JoeBiden,"Today, we honor those who answered duty’s call on June 6, 1944, on the beachheads of Normandy. We must be a living memorial to their bravery and sacrifice—and recognize always that our strength is rooted in our fervid and unfailing defense of democratic rights and freedoms. #DDay"
2664,JoeBiden,"Today, the pain is so raw it can be hard to keep faith that justice is at hand or that we will ever achieve the more perfect union we all want. But ours is a union worth fighting for, and we are all called to the cause.

2669,JoeBiden,"Tonight, I’m thinking of Breonna Taylor’s mother, Tamika Palmer. Today should have been her daughter's birthday. I've talked a lot about turning pain into purpose. But for Breonna and Tamika, it’s on us to find purpose. Our country needs to act — now. https://t.co/Ql2SyMew76"

2673,JoeBiden,Donald Trump is dangerously unfit to lead our nation through this moment. But don't just take my word for it: https://t.co/eD9z51pXDQ
2674,JoeBiden,Let’s be clear about something: The depth of this job crisis is not attributable to an act of God — but to the failure of a President.
2675,JoeBiden,"George Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe,” have echoed across our nation and around the world.

For the President to try to put any other words in his mouth is frankly despicable. https://t.co/8dWu78dtGP"

2681,JoeBiden,"To everyone struggling with mental health—you're not alone. There is no shame in seeking help, and there shouldn't be any barriers in your way to getting that help.
 
Together, we can achieve mental health parity, expand access to care, and wipe out the stigma. https://t.co/QXplsIwYTL"
2682,JoeBiden,"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but unlike this president, I’ll do my job and take responsibility. I won’t blame others. And I’ll never forget that the job isn’t about me — it’s about you."
2683,JoeBiden,"We are at our best when we open our hearts, not when we clench our fists."
2684,JoeBiden,"Jim Mattis and I haven’t always agreed on everything, but you'd be hard pressed to find a more powerful indictment of Trump's actions and character than the one he's written.

2685,JoeBiden,"I wish I could say this hate began with Donald Trump and will end with him. It didn’t, and it won’t. American history isn’t a fairytale with a guaranteed happy ending.

2687,JoeBiden,There’s no time to waste — we need to get to work immediately on real police reform. Congressman @Hakeem_Jeffries has a bill to outlaw chokeholds. Congress should put it on President Trump’s desk in the next few days. Period. https://t.co/w8XkHwFcBt
2688,JoeBiden,The nation is crying out for leadership — but this president has nothing to offer.
2689,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump has turned our country into a battlefield riven by old resentments and fresh fears. He thinks division helps him.

I ask every American to look at where we are now, and think anew: Is this who we are? Is this who we want to be? https://t.co/taSpWIFT1b"
2690,JoeBiden,We need a president who listens. https://t.co/aBdClOSDYw
2691,JoeBiden,"It’s in some of our darkest moments of despair that we’ve made some of our greatest progress — and we have that chance once again. We’re not just going to rebuild this nation — we’re going to transform it. 

There is nothing we can’t do if we do it together. https://t.co/iozMdaLtAw"
2692,JoeBiden,"If we stand together, we will rise stronger than before. A more equal, more just, more hopeful nation — closer to that more perfect union we must always strive to be."
2693,JoeBiden,"I ask all of America — not to deny our pain or cover it over — but to use it to compel our nation across this turbulent threshold into the next phase of progress, inclusion, and opportunity for our great democracy."
2694,JoeBiden,"If the Senate has time to confirm Donald Trump’s unqualified judicial nominees, it has time to pass legislation that will give true meaning to our Constitution’s promise of equal protection under the law.

No more excuses. No more delays."
2695,JoeBiden,"When 100,000 Americans died because of his incompetent leadership, this president golfed.

When Americans peacefully protested outside the White House, this president tear-gassed them for a photo-op.

Donald Trump was elected to serve us all — but he only looks out for himself."
2696,JoeBiden,"The presidency is a big job. Nobody will get everything right. I won’t either.

But I promise you this: I won’t traffic in fear and division or fan the flames of hate. I will seek to heal the racial wounds that have long plagued this country — not use them for political gain. https://t.co/TfNaoMRZQp"

2698,JoeBiden,"“I can’t breathe.”
 
George Floyd’s last words. But they didn’t die with him. They’re still being heard. They’re echoing across this nation.
 
It’s a wake-up call for all of us. https://t.co/q6kARnpJqU"
2699,JoeBiden,Julián — I made a promise to George's family that he wouldn't just become another hashtag. We're going to tackle this head on — and we're going to need your help to do it. Grateful for your support. https://t.co/D0Ssv4hU2S
2700,JoeBiden,"I’ve said from the outset of this election that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation.

Who we are. What we believe. And maybe most important—who we want to be. It’s all at stake.
 
That is truer today than ever. And it’s in this urgency we can find the path forward."
2701,JoeBiden,"The President held up a bible at St. John’s church yesterday. If he opened it instead of brandishing it, he could have learned something: 

That we are all called to love one another as we love ourselves. 

That’s hard work. But it’s the work of America."
2702,JoeBiden,"A country is crying out for leadership. Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together, leadership that can recognize the pain and deep grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time."
2703,JoeBiden,"Let us vow to make this, at last, an era of action to reverse systemic racism with long overdue and concrete changes.  This morning I'm speaking in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on where we are and where we need to go. Tune in: https://t.co/1bSdeXp8Rc"

2705,JoeBiden,"He's using the American military against the American people.

He tear-gassed peaceful protesters and fired rubber bullets.

2706,JoeBiden,"In this moment, the very soul of America is at stake.

2711,JoeBiden,Trump’s Tantrum Diplomacy is eroding U.S. credibility on the international stage. Withdrawing from @WHO during a global pandemic is a recipe for disaster and increases the cost of the American response. We must instead rally the world to confront COVID-19. https://t.co/rIlUewZNyI
2712,JoeBiden,"If we are complacent, if we are silent, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.

None of us can turn away. We all have an obligation to speak out."

2716,JoeBiden,"This is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence.

This is a national crisis — and we need real leadership right now."
2717,JoeBiden,"We are a country with an open wound.

None of us can turn away. None of us can be silent. None of us any longer can hear those words — “I can’t breathe” — and do nothing.

We must commit, as a nation, to pursue justice with every ounce of our being. https://t.co/veodlR1UYU"

1,700,000+ confirmed U.S. cases.
40,000,000+ unemployment claims filed.

Donald Trump has failed our nation."
2725,JoeBiden,"Today, we learned that another 2.1 million people filed for unemployment last week, bringing the total number of new claims since this crisis began to more than 40 million. It's just the latest evidence of Donald Trump’s utter failure of leadership. https://t.co/YSHGLBdMLG"

2732,JoeBiden,".@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Larry Kramer, an American hero. Through his activism, Larry taught us all how to speak up and demand our government do its job.

2733,JoeBiden,"There are moments in our history so grim, so heart-rending, that they're forever fixed in each of our hearts as shared grief. Today is one of those moments. 100,000 lives have now been lost to this virus.

2735,JoeBiden,"We’re in the middle of a global pandemic — and not only is Donald Trump preventing people from getting the health insurance they need, but he’s also actively trying to terminate the insurance millions already have.

2738,JoeBiden,"Last year California passed #AB5, affording gig workers protections and benefits like a minimum wage and overtime pay.

Now, gig economy giants are trying to gut the law and exempt their workers. It's unacceptable.

I urge Californians to vote no on the initiative this November."
2739,JoeBiden,"George Floyd deserved better and his family deserves justice. His life mattered.

I'm grateful for the swift action in Minneapolis to fire the officers involved — they must be held responsible for their egregious actions. The FBI should conduct a thorough investigation. https://t.co/n1tdiUba0x"
2740,JoeBiden,Wear a mask.
2741,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump's wealthy donors got tens of millions of dollars in relief, while countless small businesses were turned away. It's no wonder he didn't want any oversight.

We need a government that works for all — not just the super-wealthy."
2742,JoeBiden,"The truth is asking for money is the worst part of running for president—especially in times as tough as these. But we’re coming up on our end of month fundraising deadline, and I need your help to ensure we hit our goal.

If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/af28OgWn2G"
2743,JoeBiden,1 in 4 U.S. workers has filed for unemployment benefits in the last 10 weeks. It’s a crisis unlike anything we’ve seen in our lifetime — and the Trump Administration is failing to do enough to help.
2744,JoeBiden,"Folks, today we’re launching #League46⚾️ — a next generation coalition ready to make Donald Trump a one-term president. We've got unlimited capacity to create change — and together, we’re going to transform this country.

2746,JoeBiden,"We are months into this crisis, and Donald Trump still doesn't have a comprehensive plan when it comes to COVID-19 or the economy. It's unacceptable. I released a detailed plan laying out what I would do months ago, and have built on it since. Take a look: https://t.co/xjxsDn2qCD"
2747,JoeBiden,There’s not a single thing the American people can’t do if we do it together.

2749,JoeBiden,"This ruling goes a long way toward protecting the sacred right to vote, but there's still work to do. We've got to ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voice heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/yMzAz3NU5u"
2750,JoeBiden,"To all the members of our military and our military families, especially those who have lost their service member, thank you. We owe you. We can never lessen the magnitude of your loss, but this I can promise you: we will never forget. #MemorialDay https://t.co/b5vDrYiPL5"
2751,JoeBiden,The presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart. It requires taking on the ultimate responsibility for the biggest decisions in the world. Donald Trump simply wasn’t prepared for that. I promise you I will be.

It’s one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."

2798,JoeBiden,"It’s time we reward the people who actually make this country work. Not Wall Street CEOs — but the middle class. Ordinary women and men who are capable of doing extraordinary things when given half a chance.

2810,JoeBiden,"Moments of crisis require presidents to step up, transcend partisan politics, and unite the nation to achieve a common goal.

2853,JoeBiden,".@DrBiden and I are saddened to learn of the passing of Aimee Stephens. We send our deepest condolences to her wife, Donna, and her family. Aimee's spirit and courage will not only be her legacy but our guiding light as we carry on her fight for equality. https://t.co/F9cAnGh6VC"
2854,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration clearly knows what's needed to make workplaces safe and operational: adequate testing, contact tracing, masks, and additional precautions.

2861,JoeBiden,"In April, we raised $60.5 million between my campaign and @TheDemocrats. I'm humbled and know what a sacrifice it is to give in times as difficult as these. But May is our most important month yet, and we need your help. If you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/HbZYJWVJUs"

2884,JoeBiden,"Corruption is a feature of Donald Trump's economic agenda—not a bug. He will pick his wealthy friends and corporate cronies over working families every time.

2888,JoeBiden,Wouldn't it be nice to have a president who listens to someone other than himself? https://t.co/IN2Wtpacc4
2889,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump loves to crow about what a great economy he built.

This crisis has revealed what a failure Trumponomics has been. And American workers and families are paying the price. 

Tune in for my remarks live on @nowthisnews at 12 PM EDT."
2890,JoeBiden,"Here's the simple truth: The United States of America has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now.

We can and will overcome this."
2891,JoeBiden,"I can't hit the campaign trail in-person due to COVID-19 — so instead, I’m traveling across the country from my home in Delaware. Head over to my Instagram to catch up on today’s trip to Florida 📲."
2892,JoeBiden,"Where are the tests, Mr. President? https://t.co/thdbTtLOZC"
2893,JoeBiden,"Every step of the way, President Trump has ignored the experts, downplayed the threat COVID-19 posed, and misled the American people — and we’re all paying the price every single day.

I promise you, I will do the opposite. https://t.co/lok9PvaaFJ"
2894,JoeBiden,"Over 33 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since mid-March — one out of every five workers. It’s a national economic disaster that requires urgent action. We have to get help to everyone who needs it — efficiently, equitably, and immediately. https://t.co/6wOUCo8Dj8"
2895,JoeBiden,Real presidents lead. Reality TV presidents don’t. https://t.co/2lMwnRXLcG
2896,JoeBiden,"I believe the moral obligation of our time is to rebuild our economy in a way that finally brings everyone along. A Biden Administration will encourage the economic empowerment of African Americans and close the racial wealth and income gaps.

2897,JoeBiden,"These folks are true heroes — every single one of them.

Take a minute to read their stories: https://t.co/BU2eCifWhZ"
2898,JoeBiden,"We can't host any in-person events due to COVID-19, but that won't stop me from hitting the campaign trail—virtually, of course. Tomorrow, I'll be making stops around Florida and wrapping up the day with a virtual rally in Tampa.

Tune in at 5:15 PM ET: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/H3ZAyxhxxj"
2899,JoeBiden,"I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: No one is expendable. No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow."
2900,JoeBiden,"The nurses on the front lines of this crisis are American heroes. We owe them more than we could ever repay, but we can start by ensuring they have the protective equipment they need to stay safe, emergency paid sick leave, and premium pay. #NationalNursesDay"
2901,JoeBiden,"You heard it straight from the president himself: He wants to terminate health care for millions of Americans in the middle of a global pandemic.

We can't let that happen. https://t.co/OD1rdn8yiz"
2902,JoeBiden,"The stakes in this election have never been higher. Over the last few months, we've seen how wholly unfit Donald Trump is to lead our nation.

We have to vote him out of the White House this November."
2903,JoeBiden,"We can’t sit by as Donald Trump and Republicans use COVID-19 as an excuse to disenfranchise voters. We need to ensure people have the opportunity to vote by mail, early vote, vote absentee and, in every way possible, safely vote in person this November. https://t.co/uKRyR3LVTA"
2904,JoeBiden,"Today, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump-backed lawsuit to dismantle the ACA enters a new phase. If Trump and Republican AGs succeed, it’ll mean devastation for our health care system that will cause untold pain and suffering. We can't let that happen. https://t.co/TVb3TIKsny"
2905,JoeBiden,"These stories are heartbreaking and remind us that the numbers we see in the news are more than just statistics. Every death is a tragedy and marks a family and community that will never be the same. @DrBiden and I are keeping them all in our prayers. 
https://t.co/ajYHuY6VN2"
2906,JoeBiden,"The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood. My heart goes out to his family, who deserve justice and deserve it now. It is time for a swift, full, and transparent investigation into his murder. https://t.co/alvY5WjdHx"
2907,JoeBiden,This didn't have to happen. The Trump Administration failed to take action and produce desperately needed protective equipment — and those on the front lines of this crisis paid the price. It's heartbreaking. https://t.co/7bOj3POJCT
2908,JoeBiden,The Biden Administration will not silence scientists. https://t.co/BPXMeavONA
2909,JoeBiden,"The choice between the economy and public health is a false one—if we don’t beat the virus, we'll never get back to full economic strength and will lose countless lives. We have to get the number of new cases down and scale up testing before we return to some sense of normalcy. https://t.co/N7UT3WtNPK"
2910,JoeBiden,"It’s important to stay connected while we’re social distancing — but there’s always that one friend who doesn’t get the hint when it’s time to end the video chat. 

Glad we don’t know anyone like that — right, @KeeganMKey? https://t.co/AoDEYRTo8G"
2911,JoeBiden,"It's been a big few weeks. President Obama, Secretary Clinton, Senator Sanders, Senator Warren, and Speaker Pelosi all endorsed our campaign. Now, we need your help to keep the momentum going.

I know times are tough, but if you can, please chip in today: https://t.co/D4S84E6v2Z"
2912,JoeBiden,"Each week, I get hundreds of letters from people across the country. Folks share their hopes, ideas, struggles, and concerns — and I try to respond to as many as I can. We're going to share a few of them with you in our new series: Sincerely, Joe. https://t.co/HOHwdCcY1h"

Nurses
Medical support staff
Grocery and retail workers
Meatpackers
Delivery drivers
Transit workers
And everyone else on the front lines of this fight.

You truly are the heart and soul of this country."

2915,JoeBiden,"Across the country, folks are stepping up, taking care of their neighbors, and lending a hand to those in need. It's who we are. In times of crisis, we stand as one. And it makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/nXxczgOfAZ"

2918,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake: We can emerge from this crisis a stronger, better, and fairer nation. It’s within our power — we just need a president and an administration who are up for the task."
2919,JoeBiden,I've always believed that we've been at our best when we've acted as one America. This crisis is an opportunity for us to be that nation again. There's not a single thing we cannot accomplish if we do it together.
2920,JoeBiden,"In times of crisis, the American people deserve a president who tells them the truth and takes responsibility. Donald Trump has not been that president. https://t.co/QikZiHZeXX"
2921,JoeBiden,"The hard truth is that it didn’t have to be this bad. The lack of preparation, the slow response on testing, the failure to administer the relief in the CARES Act appropriately — all of it stems from Donald Trump’s failures as president. https://t.co/d7XZvkJKXP"
2922,JoeBiden,"This Sunday night, settle in and join labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor John Leguizamo, Secretary Hilda Solis, and Congresswoman Escobar for a #TodosConBiden discussion. Tune in now: https://t.co/o7qCPrYivT"
2923,JoeBiden,"The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
2924,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump seems to think he can direct funding based on which politicians are nice to him, which states he’s trying to win in November, and which businesses he wants to enrich — all without any accountability. @EWarren and I think that’s unacceptable. https://t.co/wbEcnkBzj1"
2925,JoeBiden,A free press is essential to a free society. That's why attacking the press and attempting to intimidate independent media is a standard part of the authoritarian playbook around the world. And it’s why Donald Trump’s efforts to demonize the media put us on such a dangerous path.
2926,JoeBiden,The U.S. Postal Service is an essential pillar of American life. We simply cannot let Donald Trump destroy it. https://t.co/1W4W6LkMum
2927,JoeBiden,"Over the last few weeks, I worked with our supporters and staff to create a code for our campaign—the principles we’ll live by, reflecting the community we’ve built, the team we aspire to be, and some of my own ‘rules’ as well.

I’m excited to share it: https://t.co/odsoUFxPmd https://t.co/ulwQwEosTz"
2928,JoeBiden,This pandemic is bigger than any one individual or country. This moment requires all of us to come together — across the nation and around the world — to solve this crisis.
2929,JoeBiden,"When I say Donald Trump is the most corrupt president in modern American history, this is what I'm talking about.

Monty Bennett should return the tens of millions of dollars he received, and we should give it to the small businesses that need it. https://t.co/CV5NqlreSs"
2930,JoeBiden,"We left a playbook. He ignored it.

We created an office to prepare for pandemics. He gutted it.

We had CDC officials in China to detect and contain outbreaks. He pulled them out.

Trump can try and shift blame all he wants, but the fact is his actions left us unprepared. https://t.co/NdsINZ307m"
2931,JoeBiden,"My heart and Jill's are with the people of Puerto Rico in the wake of another damaging earthquake. As the island grapples with both the impact of this earthquake and this pandemic, we need to ensure they get the resources and assistance needed to recover as soon as possible."
2932,JoeBiden,"To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet.

To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding. https://t.co/XK6t9oM94k"
2933,JoeBiden,"On March 6th, Donald Trump said: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

It was a lie then, and it's still not true nearly two months later. It's a disgrace, and it's slowing efforts to reopen safely.

This administration needs to act immediately to surge testing nationwide."
2934,JoeBiden,"When we come together and act as one America, there's not a single thing we cannot accomplish."
2935,JoeBiden,No one should have to pay for coronavirus treatment. Period. https://t.co/GBchrVZmDz

We can and will transform this nation — together."
2938,JoeBiden,"This crisis isn't about you, Mr. President. It's about the American people. https://t.co/3a4ppJ964Y"
2939,JoeBiden,"We have lived long enough with a President who doesn’t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That’s not me. As a Presidential candidate, I’m accountable to the American people. https://t.co/Wm1666LF8A"
2940,JoeBiden,We need a president who listens. https://t.co/pUFSMLd3pe
2941,JoeBiden,"We need more tests. Our front line workers need protective equipment. Americans need additional economic relief.

Yet the Trump Administration is spending time and energy on President Trump's wasteful border wall.

Unbelievable. https://t.co/RY12LJAYGS"
2942,JoeBiden,"The number is overwhelming, but each one represents a life thrown into uncertainty, a family unable to make ends meet, and a community worried about how it will recover.

We have to do more to help them. Now. https://t.co/TBtbqj5Kbw"
2943,JoeBiden,"- More than 60,000 people in the U.S. have died
- 30 million have filed for unemployment
- At least 1 million have gotten sick

Enough with the late night Twitter tantrums, Mr. President. It's time for you to step up and lead."
2944,JoeBiden,"Instead of preparing our country to fight COVID-19, Donald Trump wasted months and promised it would miraculously go away by April.

He was wrong. And we're all paying the price. https://t.co/R0tDbI1WZr"
2945,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump either read his daily briefings and ignored the warnings, or didn't read them at all. Either way, it's a complete and unjustifiable dereliction of duty. https://t.co/LVzlxWFTAd"
2946,JoeBiden,I’ve been a big fan of Megan’s for years and can’t wait to join her this afternoon. You can watch our chat live at 2:45 PM ET: https://t.co/RQzAg1XvVf https://t.co/tLxJeqr1w3

2949,JoeBiden,"The climate emergency isn't just a threat to our environment, it's a threat to our health, economy, and so much more. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take action to combat it before it's too late. https://t.co/08paP9Ii3C"
2950,JoeBiden,"In the middle of a global pandemic, the Trump Administration is still working to gut the Affordable Care Act and rip health care away from millions. It's morally reprehensible.

They need to drop the lawsuit immediately. https://t.co/yc6azeqLVs"
2951,JoeBiden,"With rent due in a few days and folks across the country worried they won't be able to make their payments, it's clear more needs to be done to provide relief. We need to freeze rent immediately for people who have lost their jobs and place a temporary ban on evictions."
2952,JoeBiden,"The words of a president matter — and Donald Trump has used his to downplay COVID-19, pass blame onto others, and mislead the American people. I will do the opposite. https://t.co/6ZViv3tdW7"
2953,JoeBiden,"The Trump Admin failed to provide enough testing, PPE, and safety enforcement. Workers have gotten sick, plants have closed, and the meat supply is at risk. It's past time workers have the protections they need to stay healthy and do their job safely. https://t.co/tD0Rc7P4mJ"
2954,JoeBiden,"""I wish he were president right now, but I can't wait until he is if all of us do our part to support the kind of person that we want back in the White House."" — @HillaryClinton

Join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/xyy85Q0R6e"
2955,JoeBiden,"Wear a mask in public.
Read your daily briefings.
Listen to the experts.

This really isn't rocket science. It's common sense."
2956,JoeBiden,"Throughout our history, we have emerged from every crisis stronger than before — and we will again."
2957,JoeBiden,"We owe a profound debt of gratitude to the health care workers on the front lines of this fight. I checked in with Monica, an ICU Nurse, to talk about how she's getting through this and to thank her for all she's doing: https://t.co/PLuEZWO5aQ"
2958,JoeBiden,"I couldn't agree with @HillaryClinton more. We need a president who will listen to the science, bring us together, and lead with compassion and heart. If I have the honor of being elected, that's the exact kind of president I will be. https://t.co/g7z1C8SH7e"
2959,JoeBiden,"Let me be very clear: No one is expendable.

We shouldn’t allow rationing of health care that discriminates based on age or disability."
2960,JoeBiden,"The fact is there has been so much unnecessary death in this country. If we had listened to the experts and heeded their warnings, it could have been stopped short. But Donald Trump failed to act — and now the American people are paying the price. https://t.co/oXeANYvD7T"
2961,JoeBiden,"I’ve known @HillaryClinton for years, and know that her dedication and passion for bettering our country are second to none.

2964,JoeBiden,"We're months into this crisis and workers still don't have enough protective equipment, there still aren't enough tests, and the death toll continues to rise.

The President should spend less time congratulating himself and more time doing his job. https://t.co/lVJAcHySwH"

2967,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration could have helped prevent this. But once again, they failed to take action — and now the American people are paying the price. https://t.co/OzNIJpxn2k"
2968,JoeBiden,"Testing is the springboard we need to help get our economy safely up and running again. Trump could rapidly scale it up. He hasn’t. Instead, he’s passed blame and pushed sole responsibility to governors.

We've got to do better. https://t.co/qtjjC5shEJ"
2969,JoeBiden,"COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together as one America — not by targeting others.

2974,JoeBiden,America has always met every big challenge with an even bigger solution — this moment should be no different. We need an infrastructure program that will combat climate change and create good-paying jobs at the same time.
2975,JoeBiden,"Wealthy firms with ties to Trump got millions, while countless small businesses were turned away. No wonder he wanted no one to watch how the money was deployed.

The American people deserve rigorous oversight — and small businesses deserve relief. Now. https://t.co/UNBLt4g5R9"

2998,JoeBiden,"The words of a president matter — never more than in times of crisis. A president should seek to calm and heal, provide a steady hand, and a clear path forward.

Instead, this is what we get from Donald Trump: https://t.co/0H5NTAqbY3"
2999,JoeBiden,Donald Trump will always put his wealthy and well-connected friends first — that should come as no surprise. But to allow the banks to do it on the backs of small business owners in the middle of a global pandemic is a new low — even for him. https://t.co/tG1rVOeZxs

Listen to the full episode now: https://t.co/gfVHzRcDXo https://t.co/DRJyrZ5njV"
3017,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration promised 27 million tests by the end of March.

As of now, only 4 million have been completed. It’s unacceptable.

We can’t safely reopen the economy without scaling up testing, and we can’t effectively scale up testing unless Donald Trump does his job."
3018,JoeBiden,"The Paycheck Protection Program was intended to send help to the small businesses that needed it most, but President Trump adopted an approach to help his high-priced friends. We've got to do better.

Here's what I would do if I were president: https://t.co/NXMrGe56Pg"
3019,JoeBiden,"The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is. We need to immediately expand vote-by-mail, online voter registration, and early voting to ensure everyone can safely exercise their right to participate in our electoral process. https://t.co/An7O2h1t9M"
3020,JoeBiden,"I know COVID-19 is causing many people to feel anxious about what the future holds or lonely during this time of social distancing — and that's okay, just know that you're not alone. I've asked my friend, Dr. Vivek Murthy, to share a few tips on how to get through this: https://t.co/Hx9TMlF2zP"
3021,JoeBiden,"This Holocaust Remembrance Day, as we remember the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime, we recommit to ensuring such atrocities never again occur. With anti-Semitism on the rise, all of us must root out intolerance and give hate no safe harbor."
3022,JoeBiden,"Out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again. We will not be defeated."
3023,JoeBiden,"I am honored to have the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental advocacy organization. Climate change is an existential threat, and there is no greater challenge and opportunity facing our country and our world. https://t.co/puvpCUScSn"

3030,JoeBiden,"In times of crisis, Americans stand as one. We lend a hand to our neighbors and take care of those in need. It's who we are. In that spirit, and to celebrate the one-year anniversary of our campaign, we're hosting S.O.U.L. of the Nation Saturday this weekend."
3031,JoeBiden,"We have to come together to make Donald Trump a one-term president. Once we do that, we will not only do the hard work of rebuilding this nation — we will transform it and create a better future for all."
3032,JoeBiden,"On this week’s episode of Here’s the Deal, Senator @AmyKlobuchar joins me for a discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted her family and what drove her to get involved in politics.

3033,JoeBiden,"At a time when Trump is fanning the flames of white supremacy and hatred in our country, my heart is with the families of those we lost in the Oklahoma City bombing 25 years ago today.

3038,JoeBiden,"No President can promise to prevent future outbreaks. But I can promise you that when I'm President, we will prepare better, respond better, and recover better. We'll listen to the experts and heed their advice. And I will always tell you the truth."
3039,JoeBiden,"At a time when studies are linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality rates for the most vulnerable in our society, the Trump Administration is rolling back environmental protections — allowing more poison into our air. https://t.co/047lsdtrQN"
3040,JoeBiden,"As Kierkegaard said, “faith sees best in the dark.” I've always believed that. This pandemic is keeping many communities apart, but we've still got to keep the faith. Jill and I are wishing a Happy Easter to all of the Orthodox Christians celebrating around the world. https://t.co/3gQVAOtdzk"
3041,JoeBiden,"The United States should be standing up for freedom and standing with the people of Hong Kong. Instead, Trump has said he's “standing with Xi Jinping.” That's weak. We need to be strong on values when it comes to China. That's what I'll do as president. https://t.co/O2o66tJFkY"
3042,JoeBiden,"I couldn't be prouder of my friends @LadyGaga and Chris Martin of @Coldplay for organizing the @GlblCtzn One World: #TogetherAtHome broadcast. We are all in this fight together — and if we stand as one, we will defeat COVID-19. https://t.co/TLpW631qfR"

3046,JoeBiden,Donald Trump says he’s a wartime president — it’s time for him to act like one.
3047,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump may not like it, but it's his responsibility to step up and lead our nation's testing strategy. Mass testing is key to reopening the economy and returning to some semblance of normalcy. https://t.co/AYmwnMmDB4"
3048,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump continues to do the exact thing we teach our kids not to do: blame others. It’s always somebody else's fault — never his. It’s unbelievable.

We deserve better from our commander in chief. https://t.co/ZNEDGwozyu"
3049,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump is not responsible for COVID-19, but he is responsible for our slow, uncoordinated response.

Experts say that if we had acted two weeks earlier, more lives could have been saved.

Trump failed to take swift action—and we're paying the price. https://t.co/nyq6DpLOid"
3050,JoeBiden,President Trump is trying to rewrite history when it comes to China and COVID-19 — but the facts don't back him up. Tony Blinken was the Deputy Secretary of State and is one of my top foreign policy advisors. He'll explain. https://t.co/si3vDHnF2r
3051,JoeBiden,"The uncomfortable truth is that Donald Trump left America exposed and vulnerable to this pandemic. He ignored the warnings of health experts and intelligence agencies and put his trust in China's leaders instead. Now, we're all paying the price.

Let me explain how we got here: https://t.co/esvCaGki9V"
3052,JoeBiden,I know the American people will beat this. We’re brave and big-hearted. We’ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation — and we will again.
3053,JoeBiden,We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. No one feeling ill should have to choose between earning a paycheck or staying home to recover. We need to provide paid sick leave to everyone who needs it immediately.
3054,JoeBiden,"It's been a big week: President Obama, Senator Sanders, and Senator Warren all endorsed our campaign — and we need your help to keep this momentum going.

3057,JoeBiden,"These racist acts have got to stop. No one should be targeted for what they look like, where they or their ancestors come from, or who they are.

COVID-19 is a danger to everyone. We will stop it by coming together—not by targeting people of AAPI heritage. https://t.co/y8vYAQzvsW"
3058,JoeBiden,Here's the simple truth: This nation has never been defeated when we're together — and we're not going to be defeated now. We will overcome this. https://t.co/7Irkhnbf6I
3059,JoeBiden,"When we emerge from this crisis, we can't just go back to the way things were. We need to build a better future for all."
3060,JoeBiden,"To combat COVID-19, we need a decisive public health response to curb its spread and a comprehensive economic response that delivers real relief to Americans.

I've released several plans outlining exactly what I would do if I were president. Take a look: https://t.co/YLHCGF1YM9"
3061,JoeBiden,"When somebody is President of the United States, the responsibility is total. https://t.co/hmhkBymGob"
3062,JoeBiden,"In the Biden family, we have a code: My mom used to always tell me, “Joey, no one is better than you. Everyone is your equal, and everyone is equal to you.” I’m working on building one for our campaign, too."
3063,JoeBiden,"Managing an economic relief and recovery effort is hard, painstaking work. The devil is in the details. It’s all about follow-through.

I've done the work before, and I'll be ready to do it on day one as president. https://t.co/a7oCXZqCL2"

3068,JoeBiden,"We are in a battle for the soul of this nation and I’m proud to have the fiercest of fighters, Senator @EWarren, on my side.

3073,JoeBiden,"You have great taste, @SpeakerPelosi. https://t.co/96cJJaBHFW"
3074,JoeBiden,"Stories like this showcase exactly who we are as Americans. In times of crisis, we stand as one. We help out folks we've never met, lift each other up, and do our part to ensure we make it through.

3077,JoeBiden,I am not running for office to be King of America. I respect the Constitution. I’ve read the Constitution. I’ve sworn an oath to it many times. I respect the great job so many of this country’s governors — Democratic and Republican — are doing under these horrific circumstances. https://t.co/vMtcfD45mG
3078,JoeBiden,"I want to congratulate @judgekarofsky on her hard-earned victory tonight. In the face of rampant voter suppression and GOP recklessness, the people of Wisconsin showed up and made their choice clear. I know Wisconsin will be a fairer, more just state with Jill on the court. https://t.co/Ch9PXnqekt"
3079,JoeBiden,"I am grateful to have the support of so many Wisconsinites and proud of the courage and commitment folks showed during last week's primary — but it should never have come to that.

No one should ever have to choose between their health and our democracy. https://t.co/D4PpzYkter"

3082,JoeBiden,We’re in the middle of a global pandemic. We need a president who actually listens to public health experts. https://t.co/A4LvRY36nY

3091,JoeBiden,"As we prepare to reopen America, we have to remember what this crisis has taught us: The administration’s failure to plan, to prepare, to honestly assess and communicate the threat to the nation led to catastrophic results. We cannot repeat those mistakes. https://t.co/SkfH3U792L"

3094,JoeBiden,We are in the middle of a global pandemic — and people need access to health care now more than ever. Donald Trump should reopen Obamacare enrollment immediately.

3096,JoeBiden,We need to help as many working families and small businesses as possible. Workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately. There's no time to waste. https://t.co/XFNZK6m1RV
3097,JoeBiden,"We are months into this crisis and our heroes on the front lines still don't have the protective equipment they need to stay safe. It's unconscionable.

3102,JoeBiden,We need a president who demonstrates the leadership to address every aspect of this pandemic  —  including the spate of racist incidents targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders  —  with urgency and seriousness. Donald Trump is not that president. https://t.co/4dvq4uiv17

3108,JoeBiden,"This virus can hit anyone — regardless of race, economic status, or access to power — but it doesn’t impact every community equally. It hits hardest those who are most vulnerable and who have the fewest resources.

We have to do better for all our people. https://t.co/fx76CcIPdU"
3109,JoeBiden,"The devastating unemployment numbers have made one thing even clearer: We need a fourth coronavirus relief package, and we need it fast. We need to take extraordinary steps to protect American families and ensure those laid off are made financially whole. https://t.co/PBOyM1JiUu"
3110,JoeBiden,"This morning's news of another rise in unemployment claims—on top of the millions already filed—is devastating. We have to make sure those affected get the benefits they deserve, but we can't stop there.

I'm announcing two new policies to help Americans get the relief they need: https://t.co/fUlIB2Fra2"
3111,JoeBiden,"I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be expanding the number of testing sites and surging the number of tests — not reducing them. Testing is key to finding a way out of this crisis. https://t.co/jj6ftCxVQt"
3112,JoeBiden,"We have to do more to ease the economic burden on working people. So today, I'm adopting two new policies to help deliver relief. As president, I will:

- Forgive student debt for low-income and middle class families https://t.co/wtMnhJdCaR"
3113,JoeBiden,Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for their coronavirus treatment.
3114,JoeBiden,"Eleven-year-old Isaac Johnston asked me what else kids should be doing in addition to washing their hands and staying home. My advice was simple:

3123,JoeBiden,"I know Bernie well. He’s a good man, a great leader, and one of the most powerful voices for change in our country. And it’s hard to sum up his contributions to our politics in one, single tweet. So I won’t try to. https://t.co/Z6OkCDWFNm"

3125,JoeBiden,It is a national disgrace that our health care workers still don't have the protective equipment they need. Donald Trump needs to fully use the power of the Defense Production Act to deliver these life-saving supplies. https://t.co/VrjN3fAkHi
3126,JoeBiden,We’re starting to see evidence that long-term exposure to air pollution—which disproportionately affects communities of color &amp; low-income communities—is linked to COVID-19 death rates. It's past time we treat pollution like the threat to our health it is. https://t.co/3GD15s3xSy
3127,JoeBiden,"The weeks ahead will be some of the toughest we’ve ever experienced as a nation. We need to face them with the same spirit and resolve that have guided us through previous crises. Because out of every trial and tribulation, America has always emerged stronger — and we will again."

3134,JoeBiden,"For months, I called on President Trump to step up and take the action necessary to combat COVID-19.

But week after week, he downplayed the threat it posed, misled the American people, and failed to act.

3135,JoeBiden,"Judy, from itsJudysLife, asked an important question during our Family Town Hall on COVID-19: What extra precautions should expectant mothers be taking at this time?

3151,JoeBiden,"In January, while Donald Trump was downplaying COVID-19, I wrote an op-ed calling for immediate action to combat the growing threat.

In it, I also said Trump was the worst possible leader to deal with a public health crisis.

I stand by that statement. https://t.co/PH4vF5taDa"
3152,JoeBiden,"Throughout the campaign, I’ve talked a lot about the soul of our nation — we’re seeing that soul on full display. There’s so much good happening — people reaching out to one another, neighbors helping neighbors, caring for those in need. It makes me so proud to be an American. https://t.co/aVOCC4vBWb"
3153,JoeBiden,"My friend, @GabbyGiffords, knows what it takes to persevere in the face of uncertainty. Take a few minutes to read these powerful words from her on how we can get through this — together. https://t.co/Kl0OrjB3UG"
3154,JoeBiden,"This is a headline every American should see: “Trump administration ended pandemic early-warning program to detect coronaviruses”

3157,JoeBiden,"Captain Crozier was faithful to his duty—both to his sailors and his country. Navy leadership sent a chilling message about speaking truth to power. The poor judgment here belongs to the Trump Admin, not a courageous officer trying to protect his sailors. https://t.co/AkGFdlYjwt"
3158,JoeBiden,"This is another clear warning sign that more needs to be done to keep as many people on payroll as possible.

Donald Trump needs to use all available authorities immediately to solve these shortages."

3186,JoeBiden,"Our health care workers are putting their lives on the line every day, and our president is accusing them of stealing lifesaving supplies. It's time for Donald Trump to do his job, so our heroes are able to do theirs. Lives are at stake. https://t.co/qiwRjrVUYz"
3187,JoeBiden,This is unconscionable. Americans are already afraid of the impact the deadly COVID-19 pandemic is having on their lives — they don't need the added stress of losing their health insurance. Drop the lawsuit. https://t.co/VyN90rluy9
3188,JoeBiden,"I know these are confusing and scary times, so for the first episode of our new podcast I sat down with Ron Klain, former White House Ebola Response Coordinator, to help provide some clarity around COVID-19.

3202,JoeBiden,"The Administration promised millions of tests by mid-March. But it's not happening fast enough. Where are the tests, Mr. President? https://t.co/pI8WBL7oE7"
3203,JoeBiden,"Mr. President, this isn’t about you, it’s about the health of the American people. Stop making everything personal.

You are the president of all 50 states — not just the ones that voted for you or that have governors who “treat you right.” It’s time you acted like it. https://t.co/iMoBKklscY"
3204,JoeBiden,Let me be clear: No one should have to pay for coronavirus testing or treatment.
3205,JoeBiden,"Last night, the great Rev. Joseph E. Lowery passed away, leaving an indelible mark on our country's history towards progress. He never once wavered in his spirit and in the resolve to end injustice — wherever he saw it. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family. https://t.co/FPEAyxwTxm"
3206,JoeBiden,"I just wrapped up tonight’s CNN town hall, where we discussed COVID-19 and how we move forward. I know times are tough, but the stakes in this election have never been higher. If you could chip in a few dollars I would really appreciate it. https://t.co/1PoT5yD9CO"

I thank God every day for people like @GovWhitmer, who are doing the work he won’t. https://t.co/vGruGrMVL8"
3212,JoeBiden,"The coronavirus is not Donald Trump's fault, but his inept response is.

He ignored the warnings for months, downplayed the threat it posed, and failed to take the action needed to combat the outbreak.

It's one of the greatest failures of presidential leadership in our history."
3213,JoeBiden,"It’s never a matter of if another pandemic will happen, it’s just a matter of when — and it’s the president’s job to ensure we’re ready.

Donald Trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now Americans are paying the price. https://t.co/45GVHtxUHA"
3214,JoeBiden,"The relief bill passed by Congress was a good start, but now we need to:

- Forgive at least $10,000 of student loan debt per person
- Provide emergency paid sick leave to everyone who needs it
- Ensure no one has to pay for COVID-19 treatment or an eventual vaccine"
3215,JoeBiden,"The American people are incredible. Across the country, folks are pulling together, helping one another, and doing what needs to be done to stop the spread. I'm so darn proud to be an American. https://t.co/bCyYCFBAML"
3216,JoeBiden,"President Trump is not responsible for the coronavirus, but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because he didn’t do his job when it mattered. https://t.co/xlLlQCHn3c"
3217,JoeBiden,"Thank you to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, and everyone on the front lines of this fight.

3218,JoeBiden,The Trump Administration misled the American people. https://t.co/rZehf87YUj
3219,JoeBiden,"We've gotta act now to keep the doors open for small businesses on Main Street.

It's simple: The government provides the guarantees; the banks have to move the loans out fast.

If they won't, we need a financial version of the Defense Production Act to make it happen. https://t.co/k4ePem9xLX"
3220,JoeBiden,"If I were President, here's what I would do right now:

- Use all available authorities to turn the tide on this epidemic

3222,JoeBiden,"It's hard to believe this has to be said, but if I'm elected president, I will always lead the way with science. I will listen to the experts and heed their advice. I will do the opposite of what we’re seeing Donald Trump do every day."
3223,JoeBiden,"Across the country, ordinary people are stepping up and doing extraordinary things — folks like Isaac and Stephanie, who are creating supplies for their local hospitals. Stories like this one make me so proud to be an American. We will overcome this challenge — together. https://t.co/hazgIbUHe4"
3224,JoeBiden,"The Senate passed a major economic relief package late last night. It's a very important step, but the key is how it will be executed. If I were President, here's how I'd make it work: https://t.co/RmcOh0rRPL"
3225,JoeBiden,"""If the administration had reacted to the ventilator shortage in February, a private sector effort starting now might have made lifesaving equipment in mid- to late April. Now it is unlikely to be before June.""

Donald Trump's inaction will cost lives. https://t.co/83kiIngP6o"
3226,JoeBiden,"In times of crisis, American presidents have always stepped up to meet the moment. But all we've gotten from Donald Trump are lies, excuses, and scapegoats.

3232,JoeBiden,"The character of the American people is on full display across the country. In the middle of a crisis, folks are stepping up and doing what they can to help out those in need. The Angeleno Campaign, led by my friend Mayor @EricGarcetti, is a great example of the work being done. https://t.co/eo8GGH6hmG"
3233,JoeBiden,The American people are rising to meet this moment. We need our president to do the same.
3234,JoeBiden,"Let me be very clear: No one is expendable. No matter your age, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability.

No life is worth losing to add one more point to the Dow."
3235,JoeBiden,"President Trump says no one saw this coming, but that’s just not true. Our own intelligence officials were warning of the coronavirus threat back in January. Trump ignored them, and now we’re paying the price. https://t.co/HCNDWim5Oc"
3236,JoeBiden,"As Americans, we may be physically apart, but we are truly all in this together. When we have stood as one, this nation has never been defeated. And we are not going to be defeated now. https://t.co/T3pFw3DQlj"
3237,JoeBiden,President Trump should stop attacking our nation's governors on Twitter and start delivering them the life-saving supplies they need. https://t.co/0Xa4Ewbozu
3238,JoeBiden,Let me be clear: Donald Trump knew about the threat the coronavirus posed and failed to act. It’s one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. https://t.co/l8BdATZsaL
3239,JoeBiden,The stakes in this election couldn’t be higher. Donald Trump is wholly unfit to lead this nation — and that has become even clearer in the last few weeks. We have to vote him out of the White House.
3240,JoeBiden,"I know we are up to this challenge. The American people are strong, tough, brave, and big-hearted. We can and will overcome this — together."
3241,JoeBiden,"As this public health crisis rages, with the economy in peril, and with front line workers putting their lives at risk — Trump and Republican Attorneys-General are attempting to strip health insurance away from millions.

No more games. Drop this lawsuit. Save lives. https://t.co/aSgzVzOvlV"
3242,JoeBiden,"In January, Donald Trump claimed the coronavirus was “totally under control.”

In February, he said it would disappear.

Now, he’s saying it “could’ve been stopped pretty easily if we had known.”

Donald Trump knew. He failed to act. And now we’re paying the price."
3243,JoeBiden,"Across the country, there are incredible stories of folks stepping up to help their neighbors, stories like this one. It's who we are as Americans. Brave and big-hearted. Always willing to lend a hand and care for those in need.

We will overcome this, together. https://t.co/qeNUK1y5fx"

Where are the masks?
Where are the ventilators?

The American people deserve answers, Mr. President. https://t.co/N2MWYKOzOu"
3245,JoeBiden,"Obamacare was a big deal — and that still holds true a decade later. On its tenth anniversary, we need to double down on our efforts to protect it from Donald Trump's attacks and build on it to ensure every American receives the care they need. https://t.co/aXqHL7LN9f"
3246,JoeBiden,"A $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions is unacceptable. We have to ensure the help these companies receive goes to their workers — not their CEOs.

It's time for President Trump and Mitch McConnell to put American families first. https://t.co/SWU2bLhCGj"
3247,JoeBiden,"During a public health crisis, it's unconscionable that Donald Trump and others are continuing a lawsuit designed to strip millions of people of their health insurance. This morning, I called on them to drop the lawsuit and protect Americans' health care. https://t.co/PlfeFNwhG2"
3248,JoeBiden,"What is President Trump waiting for? 

Health care workers don't have enough masks to keep themselves safe.

Hospitals are running low on ventilators that sick Americans could literally need to breathe.

He needs to act now to deliver these essential supplies. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/du94NRJ0YI"

3251,JoeBiden,"It’s simple: President Trump and Mitch McConnell are trying to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. And it’s wrong. Hardworking, struggling Americans should come first — not the big corporations looking for a blank check. https://t.co/pxGrnTYebF"
3252,JoeBiden,"President Trump’s dithering on preparing us for this global pandemic and his lies about his response to this dangerous crisis is one of the most unjustifiable failures of presidential leadership in American history. 
https://t.co/pFIoZCJWmH"
3253,JoeBiden,"On March 6th, Donald Trump claimed: “Anybody that wants a test can get a test.”

That was a flat-out lie then, and it’s still not true today. It’s a disgrace.

We need to ensure everyone who needs a test can get one free of charge. Period."
3254,JoeBiden,It's simple: The White House and @senatemajldr have tried to put corporate bailouts ahead of families. https://t.co/mFsPjmlbHW
3255,JoeBiden,"We owe a debt of gratitude to the first responders, health care providers, grocery and retail workers, transportation workers, public safety officials, and everyone working around the clock to keep our country running. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all you’re doing."
3256,JoeBiden,"In times of crisis, a president should calm and heal, lead the way with a steady hand, and provide a beacon of hope for the American people.

Donald Trump is incapable of doing that. https://t.co/0I7ZYNtqCV"

3521,JoeBiden,"Tom Steyer invested $90 million in the nation's largest private prison company — a company that allegedly hog-tied and beat kids in South Carolina. It's despicable.

Enact universal background checks.

Hold gun manufacturers accountable.

End our gun violence epidemic."

3573,JoeBiden,Last night’s debate took place blocks away from the site of the deadliest mass shooting in American history — where a lone gunman took 58 precious lives and injured hundreds of others. Yet there were zero questions about how we end our gun violence epidemic. It was unacceptable.
3574,JoeBiden,"It’s simple: If you like your private health insurance plan, you should be able to keep it. If you don’t like it, you should be able to choose a new public option.

3594,JoeBiden,"Let's be clear: Weapons of war have no place in our communities.

3655,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump will say over and over that the economy is on the ballot this year. It is. But America’s character is on the ballot too. And despite what Trump says, we don’t have to choose one or the other.

We can be a good country with a good economy. https://t.co/VKxpWqMeHg"

3673,JoeBiden,"Five.

That’s how many times Senator Sanders voted against the Brady background check bill that has kept 3 million firearms out of dangerous hands.

I helped pass it.

We need a president who'll stand up to the @NRA — not stand with them against lifesaving gun safety measures."

3677,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump called our troops’ traumatic brain injuries “headaches.” 

If my son had still been there in Iraq, I’d have been so damn angry.

3679,JoeBiden,"I led the Obama-Biden Administration’s efforts to pass and implement the Recovery Act, which saved the American economy from another depression and sent South Bend, IN, over $75 million to invest in projects around the town.

3682,JoeBiden,We’re not only going to have to win the White House but we have to bring along the United States Senate. We can’t do that with someone who labels themselves as a Democratic Socialist. #DemDebate

3687,JoeBiden,"When I met Brayden this week, he had a familiar anxiety on his face. It was the anxiety of a kid with a stutter, something I struggled to overcome when I was a kid too. Here's what I told him. https://t.co/IIF386n2GU"
3688,JoeBiden,We need a president who chooses compassion over cruelty.
3689,JoeBiden,It’s not hyperbole to say that we are in a battle for the soul of this nation. Everything that makes us who we are is at stake. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and take back this country.
3690,JoeBiden,Empathy matters. Compassion matters. We have to reach out to one another and heal this country — and that’s what I’ll do as president. https://t.co/XVDnUc32Ij
3691,JoeBiden,"John DiEleuterio had a huge heart and was a friend I counted on for over 50 years. As a Colonel in the National Guard and as the State Director in my Senate office, John served our country with dignity and distinction. Jill and I send our condolences to Maureen and his family."

3696,JoeBiden,"Today, @DougJones stood up and did the right thing. He showed courage on the Senate floor, when many did not.

3701,JoeBiden,"Mayor Pete likes to call me part of the old failed Washington. Was it a failure when I helped pass Obamacare, the Paris Agreement, the Violence Against Women Act, or the assault weapons ban?

I have a stronger record of passing big, progressive legislation than anyone running."
3702,JoeBiden,"Last night, President Trump turned his constitutional obligation to inform Congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television. It was a shameful display. #SOTU"

3731,JoeBiden,"Trump further diminished the U.S. in the eyes of the world by expanding his travel ban. This new “African Ban,” is designed to make it harder for black and brown people to immigrate to the United States. It’s a disgrace, and we cannot let him succeed. https://t.co/oePD5eSAWY"
3732,JoeBiden,"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, and fairness—we've never fully lived up to them, but we've never stopped trying.

3734,JoeBiden,"We are in the midst of a crisis with the coronavirus. We need to lead the way with science — not Donald Trump’s record of hysteria, xenophobia, and fear-mongering. He is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency."

3742,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump's Muslim ban is a direct betrayal of America’s most fundamental freedom: religious freedom. And now he's adding more countries to his list of who's not welcome in America.

3743,JoeBiden,"I've stood up to bullies my entire life, and I'm ready to stand up to the one in the White House. I hope President Trump heard that message loud and clear when he saw this ad air during Fox &amp; Friends this morning. https://t.co/TImcrK1T48"
3744,JoeBiden,"Time and time again, Donald Trump has proven he has no moral rudder. Instead of having respect for others, he insults and demeans. He preys on divisions and stokes hate, instead of healing and uniting.

Trump is everything we aspire not to be as Americans."
3745,JoeBiden,.@JohnDelaney ran his campaign with conviction to make our government work for the American people. He will continue to be an important voice in shaping our country for years to come. https://t.co/Dqg0D7s0p7
3746,JoeBiden,"Let's be clear: If Donald Trump can afford to give giant tax breaks to the super-wealthy, then he can afford to ensure that the most vulnerable in our society receive the health care they need and deserve.

We should be expanding Medicaid — not cutting it. https://t.co/akawD7sV8f"
3747,JoeBiden,"Airline catering workers will feed thousands of people traveling to the Super Bowl, but can’t afford to feed their own families. I stand in solidarity with @unitehere_sofla. @AmericanAir needs to ensure @LSGSkyChefs pay their workers living wages. https://t.co/4nx9nYHoET"

3753,JoeBiden,"It’s no understatement to say that Donald Trump represents an existential threat to the future of our country. He has repeatedly shown little understanding of — and zero regard for — our laws, our values, or our democracy.

We have to get him out of the White House."
3754,JoeBiden,Ending gun violence is on the ballot. We have to take on the powerful gun lobby and pass common-sense measures that will keep our kids safe. I've beaten the @NRA twice — and I'll do it again as president. https://t.co/lrgFPskUrf
3755,JoeBiden,The true character of a person is revealed in the Oval Office. We saw it with President Obama. We're seeing it with President Trump — and what we've witnessed from this president over the last three years makes clear that we can't give him another four. https://t.co/SEb3XztnKI

3758,JoeBiden,Equal pay for equal work is common sense — and long overdue. That's why the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act was the first law that the Obama-Biden Administration signed 11 years ago today. We have to continue the fight until we close the gender pay gap once and for all.
3759,JoeBiden,We need a president who respects religious freedom. https://t.co/5PrjnXCig5
3760,JoeBiden,The decision to allow the Trump Administration to discriminate against immigrants based on wealth is a cruel betrayal of our values. The next four years could have a generational impact on our federal courts — we have to make Donald Trump a one-term president.

3765,JoeBiden,A peace plan requires two sides to come together. This is a political stunt that could spark unilateral moves to annex territory and set back peace even more.

3771,JoeBiden,Let's be clear: Donald Trump's Muslim ban was never about safety — it was a blatant ploy to fan the flames of bigotry and score points with his political base. I will end it.
3772,JoeBiden,"With just one week until the Iowa Caucus, we need your help to bring us across the finish line. Every door knocked, phone call made, or dollar chipped in goes a long way in this homestretch. Head to https://t.co/ie4bECkx0e to get involved. https://t.co/7F1dyHYd4V"
3773,JoeBiden,"On #HolocaustMemorialDay and the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, we honor the millions of Jews and other victims whose lives were extinguished by the Nazi regime. Today and every day, we must give hate no safe harbor to ensure such atrocities never again occur."
3774,JoeBiden,"Selling off public services to private interests at the expense of workers and their communities should be a non-starter. Congratulations to the members of @ATUComm, who went on strike for 84 days to fight for their rights — and won. https://t.co/EJ4JglWcuB"
3775,JoeBiden,Climate change poses an existential threat to our future — and we are running out of time to address it. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and rally the world to meet the urgency of this moment. https://t.co/7kNfqn3EGi
3776,JoeBiden,"I'm grateful to have the endorsement of the @scj. The battle for the soul of this nation begins in Iowa — and I'm confident that together, we'll make Donald Trump a one-term president and take back this country. https://t.co/xbARVjoFU6"
3777,JoeBiden,"Congrats @MichelleObama on winning a Grammy for telling your story with strength — and with grace. Jill and I are so thrilled for you. Just beat Barack to an EGOT, will ya? https://t.co/EpDsGz4KYj"
3778,JoeBiden,Jill and I are sending our prayers to the Bryant family and to everyone who lost loved ones in today’s crash. It’s a reminder of how special — and fragile — life is. And it’s a reminder that we’ve got to make every day count.

3780,JoeBiden,"The seas are rising. Australia is burning. And in this moment of crisis, our President thinks windmills cause cancer. Solving the climate crisis, starts with beating Donald Trump. And once I do, we'll pass my ambitious climate plan. https://t.co/uClGwalbRW"
3781,JoeBiden,"Firefighters represent the best of America — they put their lives on the line every single day and selflessly rush toward danger to save others.

3784,JoeBiden,"One of my favorite parts of the campaign trail is meeting folks across the country and hearing their stories. So my team and I are picking one lucky person to sit down with me for a cup of joe.

Chip in today for your chance to win: https://t.co/IYZ70gr2h9 https://t.co/YKzqbOMTvs"
3785,JoeBiden,Let’s be clear: Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.
3786,JoeBiden,"After four years of Betsy DeVos and the Trump Administration, our students and educators will need strong advocates in the White House who will repair the damage they have caused. That's exactly what they'll have with me and @DrBiden. https://t.co/ClKKzccpiU"

3789,JoeBiden,"The next president will face the enormous task of picking up the pieces left by President Trump. They will have to salvage our reputation, rebuild confidence in our leadership, and mobilize the world to meet new challenges. There will be no time to lose. https://t.co/oizwBqMFNL"
3790,JoeBiden,"Great news out of Utah. No child should be subjected to the vile, immoral practice of conversion therapy. We have to ban it at the federal level and make sure every young person is affirmed and accepted just as they are. https://t.co/DVVRikDZ7a"
3791,JoeBiden,"I tell people that when a family experiences tragedy, the most important thing they can do is to turn their grief into purpose. @fred_guttenberg found his purpose — and his courage and determination have helped fuel the fight for gun safety reform. https://t.co/CAEHM0zBeI"
3792,JoeBiden,"U.S. troops hurt in Iran's missile attack are being evaluated for traumatic brain injuries. To Trump, it's just “headaches.” We need a president who respects our service members and honors our sacred duty to care for our wounded warriors. https://t.co/lqzSDWezk7"
3793,JoeBiden,It’s not hyperbole to say Donald Trump is a threat to our planet. We have to get him out of the White House and treat the climate emergency like the existential threat that it is. Our future depends on it.
3794,JoeBiden,"On the anniversary of a hopeful moment, it's clear Trump's Venezuela policy is a dead end. Millions are suffering with the Maduro regime still in power. https://t.co/dvUGFlTFNO"
3795,JoeBiden,"It’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part to beat Donald Trump and take back this country. And with just 11 days until Iowa, your help has never been more important. Head to https://t.co/0yBebrK3rY to take action from anywhere in the country."
3796,JoeBiden,"When we divert public funds to private schools, we undermine the entire public education system. We've got to prioritize investing in our public schools, so every kid in America gets a fair shot. That's why I oppose vouchers. #Espinoza"
3797,JoeBiden,Empathy matters. I think it's important — not only for leaders — but for everybody to treat people with respect. https://t.co/5HhEOowbBg
3798,JoeBiden,An administration that gives trillions in tax cuts to giant corporations and the super-wealthy but cuts food assistance for the most vulnerable in our society is morally bankrupt.
3799,JoeBiden,"47 years ago today, #RoevWade recognized a woman's constitutional right to choose — but that right is under attack across the country. We must codify Roe into law and fight back against any state laws that violate it."
3800,JoeBiden,"My administration will not cut Social Security or Medicare benefits. Period. We’ll expand them. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is saying he would consider sacrificing seniors' benefits to protect tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and big companies. We have to defeat him in November. https://t.co/ChUrheK1ga"

- Eliminate all private dollars from federal elections
- End Citizens United and dark money groups
- Increase transparency and accountability"
3806,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake, Obamacare is on the ballot this November. Coverage for millions of Americans and protections for pre-existing conditions are on the ballot.

We have to protect the progress we've made and show up to the polls to defend the Affordable Care Act. https://t.co/tWaiPrVAKr"
3807,JoeBiden,"Ten years ago, the Supreme Court unleashed an unlimited flood of dark money into our politics with its Citizens United decision—further corrupting our politics &amp; eroding faith in our democracy.

It’s time we end Citizens United. Add your name if you agree: https://t.co/WJ5YRnXGPm"
3808,JoeBiden,I was reminded this weekend by Pastor McCallum that we've got to bring a sense of community back to this country. That work starts now. https://t.co/TB2R8sg3z7

3811,JoeBiden,"The courage shown today by the lawmakers, staff, and gun safety advocates in Richmond is inspiring. It's long past time the calls for reform are met with concrete action that ends our gun violence epidemic. #IStandWithVirginia today, and every day, until the job is done. https://t.co/ouiZVkgzrT"
3812,JoeBiden,From my days as a public defender to my time as Vice President — I've spent my entire career fighting against discrimination and championing civil rights. I'm running for president to bring that fight to the Oval Office and give everyone a full share of the American dream. https://t.co/y015JDgrti
3813,JoeBiden,"As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.” As we seek to restore the soul of this nation from a long moral lapse, we look to those words and take solace that this too shall pass and justice will prevail. #MLKDay"
3814,JoeBiden,Honored to have won Jacquelyn's endorsement. https://t.co/tGpNZjXacu
3815,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump's poisonous rhetoric and divisive politics have brought America to an inflection point. In this moment, we have an enormous opportunity to take the next great step forward as a nation.

Let's get to work. We can do this, together. https://t.co/4jTqAI3aCj"
3816,JoeBiden,This is a big victory for South Carolina. The right to vote is the most fundamental American right there is — we have to break down barriers to the ballot box and ensure every American can make their voice heard. https://t.co/ASdIG2vkFe
3817,JoeBiden,"The big banks didn't need an additional $32 billion in savings, and their shareholders certainly didn't need an extra $21.5 billion in payouts.

It's time we ensure corporations pay their fair share and that our country rewards work — not wealth. https://t.co/eW8qS4yNBf"
3818,JoeBiden,"The 60th anniversary of our alliance with Japan reminds us that close partnership and deep cooperation are among our greatest assets. I understand the value of our alliances; they make us stronger. I would build on this legacy, rather than dismantling it."
3819,JoeBiden,"I stand with the snow plow drivers who work day in and day out to keep our roads safe, often in dangerous conditions. Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits. Stay safe out there, @IBT_320. https://t.co/hVLXy2urWP"
3820,JoeBiden,"Thank you @Captsully for sharing your story. There’s a lot of kids who I bet needed to hear it. 

Being different isn’t a barrier to success. It can give you the strength to save lives in a crash landing — or even run for President. https://t.co/0sYl6VhJyr"
3821,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump continues to embrace corruption at home and abroad. Rather than addressing the root causes pushing people to flee Central America, he has undermined anti-corruption bodies—first in Guatemala and now in Honduras. https://t.co/bJzaXo3XAQ"
3822,JoeBiden,"There used to be a basic bargain in this country—when you worked hard, you shared in the prosperity you helped create. But CEOs and Wall Street continue to put profits over workers. It's wrong.

We have to restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone earns what they deserve."
3823,JoeBiden,"Together, we're going to beat Donald Trump and take back this country.

Chip in if you’re ready to leave him in the dust: https://t.co/wyp2zOcUWA https://t.co/qCgcncjpln"

3827,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump says he prefers war heroes who ""weren't captured."" He attacks Gold Star families. Now he calls our generals “losers,"" “babies” and “dopes.""

He degrades the office he holds every day. https://t.co/mvLLdHCzRz"
3828,JoeBiden,No malarkey here. https://t.co/7ODeSCfYMu

3830,JoeBiden,"It is a moral failing when children are ripped from their parents' arms, locked away in overcrowded detention centers, and denied toothbrushes and soap.

We have to end Donald Trump's cruel policies and build a fair and humane immigration system."
3831,JoeBiden,"This isn't just about who I am, this is about who we are as a country. We're tough, resilient, but always full of hope. With every fiber in my being, I believe there’s not a single thing we can't do—if we do it together. https://t.co/GfPWX1VTvH"

3836,JoeBiden,The character of our nation is on the ballot in this election. We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are — and we have to prove that this November. https://t.co/dToLAHQ2Hd
3837,JoeBiden,"If true, this constitutes an unprecedented attack on our Foreign Service. Amb. Yovanovitch spent her life advancing U.S. interests, only to be defamed by this administration. Our diplomats deserve better. It's inexcusable that Sec. Pompeo won't defend them. https://t.co/R3rCeQEKX9"
3838,JoeBiden,"America has never lived up to our promise of equality for all, but we've never stopped trying. Virginia brought us closer to that highest ideal today by ratifying the long overdue #ERA.

Women's rights should be explicitly in our Constitution—not left to the whims of legislators. https://t.co/F4E4PYEo0f"
3839,JoeBiden,"I'm more optimistic about our future today than I was when I got elected to the Senate as a 29-year-old. If we come together and unite this country, there's not a single thing we can't do. https://t.co/LGNHTgei6W"
3840,JoeBiden,"My thoughts and prayers are with Mustafa Kassem's family at this difficult time. His death, after six years in an Egyptian jail, is an outrage.

3843,JoeBiden,"I'm ready to debate Donald Trump on the economy. The American people are getting clobbered, and the wealthy are the only ones doing well. We have to rebuild the middle class, and this time, make sure everyone comes along. https://t.co/C36Kym6X8J"
3844,JoeBiden,"Cornell is right — everything is at stake this November. We have to get Donald Trump out of the White House and unite this country. Because if we come together and act as one America, there is nothing that we can't accomplish. https://t.co/RkNCr4M0ag"
3845,JoeBiden,"Historically Black Colleges and Universities have always been the heartbeat of our country’s fight for justice. That’s why I’ll invest $70 billion in HBCUs and Minority-Serving Institutions.

3850,JoeBiden,"Republicans have savaged my only surviving son. They’ve spread lies about me that networks won’t even carry. It doesn’t matter if they go after me.

As President of the United States, I have to be able to not only fight — I have to heal. And that’s what I’ll do if I’m elected."
3851,JoeBiden,Child care is personal to me: I was a single parent as a young senator. I commuted home to Delaware every night to tuck my kids into bed. Child care should be affordable for every parent. #DemDebate
3852,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake, the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed walking away from the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He failed on both accounts. https://t.co/S2nsclIN1B"
3853,JoeBiden,"Under the Biden administration, labor and environmental groups will be at the table to negotiate trade agreements. Period. https://t.co/gKXwU2SpVu"

3857,JoeBiden,"I wouldn’t meet with Kim Jong Un without pre-conditions. By meeting with him, Donald Trump gave Kim Jong Un what he was looking for: legitimacy. I will work closely with our allies and hold China accountable for its lack of pressure on the Kim regime’s bad behavior. #DemDebate"
3858,JoeBiden,No president can take our country to war without the informed consent of the American people. #DemDebate
3859,JoeBiden,There’s a big difference between sending tens of thousands of American combat troops to the Middle East indefinitely – which I oppose and will end – and using small teams of special forces to support local forces doing the fighting to advance our common security. #DemDebate
3860,JoeBiden,No one should shed a tear for Qassem Soleimani. But Trump’s reckless escalation and thoughtless withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has made America less safe. We need a return to diplomacy and a steady hand at the wheel to navigate an increasingly dangerous world. #DemDebate
3861,JoeBiden,"When Trump discarded the Iran nuclear deal he promised it would produce a “better” one and curb Iranian aggression—the reverse happened. Iran has restarted its nuclear program and become more provocative. I’ll return to smart, disciplined diplomacy to address the threats we face."
3862,JoeBiden,In 2009 President Obama asked me to oversee our effort to bring home our combat troops. I’ll put my record and my judgment up against anyone in terms of who is the right person to be Commander in Chief. #DemDebate
3863,JoeBiden,"I’m about to step on stage for tonight’s #DemDebate in Iowa. Make sure to follow along here and on @TeamJoe for updates throughout the night, and tune in to @CNN at 9 PM ET to watch live!"

3865,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump has once again sided with corporations over American workers by making it easier for them to get away with wage theft and overtime violations.

It's time we put workers' rights over corporate greed and ensure everyone has the workplace protections they deserve. https://t.co/6SgkalkZCT"
3866,JoeBiden,"We’re in a battle for the soul of our nation — and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has:

- Fanned the flames of hatred and bigotry
- Embraced dictators
- Ripped children from their parents' arms
- Degraded our national character

We have to get him out of the White House."
3867,JoeBiden,"Why are you so obsessed with me, Mr. President? https://t.co/BbAawEvQo6"
3868,JoeBiden,"I'm married to a teacher, I see firsthand how difficult it is. We've got to let educators do their job so our students can succeed - that means paying them the salaries they deserve and giving them the respect that they've earned. https://t.co/iRLj2DPa2o"
3869,JoeBiden,"From day one, Donald Trump has been determined to roll back every environmental protection he could get his hands on.

At a time when the climate crisis is pushing our planet to the brink, we should strengthen protections — not weaken them. https://t.co/RPfnT2Fz9y"
3870,JoeBiden,"The stakes of this election could not be higher. Eight years of Donald Trump will fundamentally alter the character of our nation. We can't let that happen.

We have to do everything in our power to make him a one-term president."
3871,JoeBiden,"When we said to give us your tired, poor, and huddled masses, we absolutely did not mean ""unless they are fleeing violence."" https://t.co/OeIWRpPC8I"

3873,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump has no strategy when it comes to Iran. No endgame. The only way out of his self-made crisis is through diplomacy — clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship. https://t.co/yfb8OE98Xu"
3874,JoeBiden,"Cory, you campaigned with joy and heart, and instead of just talking about bringing people together, you did it every day. You made our politics better just by running. Grateful to you and looking forward to your continued leadership."
3875,JoeBiden,Puerto Rico should not be treated any differently than if this happened anywhere else in America — it's wrong. We should be surging all the help that is needed to fix the damage done by the earthquakes. https://t.co/AIAuQy2Fjs
3876,JoeBiden,"There’s enormous opportunity once we get rid of Donald Trump. We can:

- Address the climate emergency
- Build a more inclusive middle class
- Build on Obamacare
- Ensure our government works for everyone — not just the powerful"
3877,JoeBiden,"Trump’s reckless policies have needlessly endangered our interests in the Middle East. But none of us should be under any illusions about the Iranian regime, and the Iranian people — like all people everywhere — have the right to peaceful protest. The world should support them."

3880,JoeBiden,I've seen firsthand how hard our educators work for little pay and with few resources. They deserve better. It's time we support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt
3881,JoeBiden,What kind of nation are we if we simply accept that kids learn active shooter drills with their ABCs? We have to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reforms to protect our children. https://t.co/d76FxbwBuB
3882,JoeBiden,Congratulations to President Tsai and the people of Taiwan for another successful election. You are stronger because of your free and open society. The United States should continue strengthening our ties with Taiwan and other like-minded democracies. https://t.co/NAt6ldYpRj
3883,JoeBiden,Members of Teamsters Local 104 are striking against ASARCO for their unfair labor practices—I called into the picket line to support them. Every company should provide its workers with the pay and benefits they've earned—especially one that pulls in over $1 billion in profits. https://t.co/Pm1EYxodmU
3884,JoeBiden,"Firefighters represent the best of America — courageous, selfless, and always answering the call to duty. I'm grateful to those who are heading to help our friends in Australia battle devastating wildfires. https://t.co/ncemFZLB6M"

3886,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake: the situation with Iran is a crisis of Donald Trump's own making. He brought us to the brink of war with no plan and no strategy.

3887,JoeBiden,"I've released 21 years of my tax returns. Why haven't you released any of yours, Mr. President?

Release your taxes or hush up about corruption. https://t.co/g1C7l4imKW"
3888,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump brought us dangerously close to starting a new war with Iran without any semblance of a plan.

This moment requires a leader who will be ready on day one to pick up the pieces and repair the damage Trump has caused. https://t.co/HDNnbR8tEB"
3889,JoeBiden,This election is about the soul of America — and a nation that allows our epidemic of school shootings to continue has a troubled soul. We have to beat the @NRA and get weapons of war off our streets. Lives depend on it. https://t.co/WtSljHo3ka
3890,JoeBiden,Facebook continues to put their profits over the truth — allowing politicians like Donald Trump to spend an unthinkable amount of money on paid disinformation. Our democracy is worse off for their failure to confront this. https://t.co/sKaAjHsKc7
3891,JoeBiden,"We are so much better than who Donald Trump thinks we are. We don’t have to give in to his dark, petty, angry vision of America. We can choose to be the more perfect union we have always aspired to be — and restore the soul of this nation. https://t.co/nkD23GxirG"
3892,JoeBiden,"I'm thankful no one was hurt in last night's attack. But we're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran Deal (which even his advisors said was working), turned his back on our allies, and had no strategy for what comes next."
3893,JoeBiden,Gabby is one of the strongest people I know. The resilience she has shown is remarkable. I'm inspired by her courage in turning tragedy into purpose and grateful for her relentless determination to make our country a safer place for all. https://t.co/PHlQy6cxYF
3894,JoeBiden,"3,820 days — that's how long it's been since the federal minimum wage was last raised. It’s unacceptable. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour nationwide should be just our starting point for ensuring workers receive the pay they deserve. https://t.co/pL3qZXsCJu"
3895,JoeBiden,"Pope Francis is absolutely right. As a nation, we have a moral obligation to ensure everyone has access to the care they need. Health care is a right for all — not a privilege for the few. https://t.co/c84y4GAMCq"
3896,JoeBiden,"We have to rebuild the middle class. But this time, we have to make sure that people historically left out of the middle class — whether due to race, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or religion — have the chance to be included in our success. https://t.co/YTwf2WYOYd"

3899,JoeBiden,"I stand with the people of Puerto Rico, our fellow citizens, in this moment of need. It’s unconscionable that so much of the hard work of disaster recovery continues to be left undone. We've got to deliver concrete support for Puerto Rico now before more lives are lost. https://t.co/b4baNN7hYj"

3901,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump is the most reckless &amp; incompetent commander in chief we've ever had. Every day he directs American national security is a dangerous day for the world.

3902,JoeBiden,"At 1:00 PM, I'll be speaking about the escalating situation with Iran and the imperative need to restore respected, responsible, and dignified leadership on the world stage. Tune in to watch live: https://t.co/wjXqg8F4Z9"
3903,JoeBiden,"Trump wants to ignore climate science when making infrastructure decisions. In the Biden Administration, every dollar spent toward rebuilding our roads, bridges, buildings, the electric grid, and our water infrastructure will be used to reduce and withstand a changing climate. https://t.co/QYjbobZQAD"
3904,JoeBiden,"On Día de los Reyes, as Christmas comes to a close, we are reminded of the call of the three kings: to give of ourselves without expectation, seek peace no matter how long the journey, and know that a bright future is within reach. Jill and I wish a Happy Three Kings’ Day to all!"
3905,JoeBiden,Let's be clear: Donald Trump does not have the authority to take us into war with Iran without Congressional approval. A president should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.
3906,JoeBiden,John Deere is laying off yet another round of workers in Iowa because of Donald Trump's reckless trade war. All he's succeeded at is taking jobs away from American workers. It has to stop. https://t.co/bIXYrQ240G
3907,JoeBiden,I stand in solidarity with those marching in New York against the rise of anti-Semitism. This is what the battle for the soul of our nation looks like — and it's up to all of us to reject intolerance in all its forms and give hate no safe harbor. https://t.co/XyTOdFhpKM
3908,JoeBiden,"Our Statue of Liberty invites in the tired, the poor, the huddled masses yearning to breathe free. But Donald Trump has slammed the door in the face of families fleeing persecution and violence. Jill traveled to Matamoros to shed light on how these policies hurt asylum seekers. https://t.co/2Bwwl2pEzq"
3909,JoeBiden,"This is a crisis of Donald Trump’s own making. He claimed pulling out of the Iran deal would deter Iranian aggression and result in a better deal. He has failed on both counts.

3918,JoeBiden,My statement on the killing of Qassem Soleimani. https://t.co/4Q9tlLAYFB
3919,JoeBiden,Donald Trump stacked the Supreme Court with justices to try to overturn Roe v. Wade—and now Republicans are seizing the opportunity to restrict a woman's constitutional right to choose.

3932,JoeBiden,2019 was a year of record violence — it will be a moral failure if we allow 2020 to be the same. We have to elect leaders with the courage to take on the @NRA and pass common-sense gun safety reform. We have to end this epidemic. https://t.co/Qhv4SVzc9X
3933,JoeBiden,"Next year could give us one of two things: a new administration or four more years of Donald Trump.

We can defeat him, but only with your help. Chip in what you can before our midnight deadline: https://t.co/e9CcZTIZ9s"

3935,JoeBiden,"We all said that Donald Trump’s trade war would lead to job losses and higher prices.

And now, it’s leading to job losses and higher prices.

I didn't read “Art of the Deal,” but this is the textbook definition of a failed negotiation. https://t.co/6xnbWRqtsC"
3936,JoeBiden,"Tomorrow marks our end-of-year fundraising deadline and we need your help to reach our goal. Our campaign relies on supporters like you giving $5, $10, $20 at a time.

3946,JoeBiden,"Our end-of-year fundraising deadline is quickly approaching — and we need your help to reach our goal in order to make the investments in Iowa necessary to win.

With just 38 days until the caucus, we need every dollar we can get. Chip in today: https://t.co/Kdq4kVimfs"
3947,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump is a threat to the future of our planet. Over the last year, he has rolled back regulations on:

4196,JoeBiden,"This election is about the soul of our nation—and Donald Trump is poison to our soul. He has no regard for our Constitution and violates everything we stand for. It’s not hyperbole to say that this is about saving America.
 
We have to decide who we are and who we want to be."

4200,JoeBiden,"Something is wrong in America when the average Latina makes just over half what the average non-Latino white man makes. Donald Trump has undone much of what we did in the White House to fix the gender pay gap. When I'm president, I'll work to right that wrong. #LatinaEqualPayDay"

4204,JoeBiden,"We know in our bones this election is different. If we give Donald Trump eight years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation. We cannot let that happen.

We must make Trump a one-term president. https://t.co/EuEVkE424E"
4205,JoeBiden,"The energy at the @NVDems’ First in the West event was incredible. Folks are fired up to take back our country and make Donald Trump a one-term president.

4212,JoeBiden,"I’ve spent my entire career fighting the abuse of power. That’s what motivated me to write &amp; champion the Violence Against Women Act. The law helped change our culture—but there’s more work to do.

4218,JoeBiden,"Trump's intervention in the American military justice system to pardon service members accused or convicted of war crimes betrays the rule of law, the values that make our country exceptional &amp; the men and women who wear the uniform honorably. He is not fit to command our troops."
4219,JoeBiden,"The Foreign Service Officers who testified this week represent the best of America. They deserve our support &amp; thanks for their work to advance American interests, not the scorn &amp; harassment they get from the President. Every day, Donald Trump reminds us he's unfit to serve."

4533,JoeBiden,"Using religion or culture to discriminate against or demonize LGBTQ individuals is never justified—not anywhere in the world.

I will send a clear message from the top of our government: prejudice is prejudice, inhumanity is inhumanity, and the U.S. will not stand for it. https://t.co/HUMcFVSSfA"
4534,JoeBiden,"I spent my night at the HRC forum talking about the fundamental respect every human being deserves. You spent yours showing how little respect for anyone else you have. America is so much stronger than your weakness, @realDonaldTrump."
4535,JoeBiden,Honored to be asked a question at tonight's #EqualityTownHall by my friend Judy Shepard. It was a privilege to work with her to secure the passage of legislation that extended our hate crimes laws to crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

4539,JoeBiden,"For all the hard-won progress we've made in the fight for LGBTQ equality, we're not done — not nearly.

4540,JoeBiden,Americans should decide American elections. Period. https://t.co/oc5HavIiuf
4541,JoeBiden,I sat down with @MaraKeisling of the @NCTEActionFund to discuss the progress we’ve made on LGBTQ rights and the work that remains.

We must prove him wrong. He must be impeached. https://t.co/4ahsVPiqxX"
4546,JoeBiden,"Like every bully, President Trump is lashing out because he’s afraid. He’s afraid of how badly I will beat him next November.

Let’s make his worst fear a reality: https://t.co/a9zec0IrRf https://t.co/kjrK3mzzjk"
4547,JoeBiden,"Last night, history was made in the birthplace of the civil rights movement, when Steven Reed became the first African American mayor of Montgomery."

4549,JoeBiden,"To preserve our Constitution, our democracy, and our basic integrity — Donald Trump should be impeached. https://t.co/fa14AGZdW9"
4550,JoeBiden,"Two days ago, Trump impulsively gave Turkey a green light to invade Syria, blindsiding our military. Today, we see the consequences—Turkish forces attacking the fighters that helped us take on ISIS. It’s a betrayal, takes pressure off the terrorist threat, &amp; leaves us less safe."
4551,JoeBiden,"With his words and with his actions, President Trump has indicted himself.

He should be impeached."
4552,JoeBiden,Join me now as I take the stage: https://t.co/xQ62JANeIt

Donald Trump has spent his entire career abusing his power."

4558,JoeBiden,Jill and I wish Jewish communities around the world an easy fast as they gather to observe Yom Kippur. The Day of Atonement is an important reminder of the obligation we all share to reflect on our actions and recommit to our values in the year ahead. L’Shana Tovah.
4559,JoeBiden,"No one should live in fear of being fired because of who they are or whom they love. We must stand up to President Trump’s relentless attacks on LGBTQ rights and continue the fight for full equality—because every American deserves to live open, proud, and free. #RiseUpOct8"
4560,JoeBiden,"A good education should be a reliable pathway to the middle class. But for too many, earning a credential or degree after high school comes with a mountain of debt or is out of reach altogether.

Today, I’m releasing my plan to change that: https://t.co/lU9sfUkPUG"
4561,JoeBiden,"Firefighters and teachers should not pay a higher tax rate than the wealthiest in our country. As president, I will reverse President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and create a tax code that works for the middle class.

It’s time we reward work, not just wealth."
4562,JoeBiden,"Abuse of power is the defining characteristic of the Trump presidency.

We must stop him. https://t.co/5IojhccVq3"

4564,JoeBiden,"This week, the Trump Administration is set to argue before the Supreme Court that it’s legal to discriminate against someone simply because of who they are or whom they love. It’s a dangerous attack on the civil rights of LGBTQ Americans and everything we stand for."
4565,JoeBiden,"We cannot, and will not, stand for President Trump’s corruption. We will beat him like a drum."
4566,JoeBiden,"If we stand together we can, and will, end our gun violence epidemic. Read my full plan to address this public health epidemic at https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV.
https://t.co/SjcCZfVbK7"

https://t.co/btVh7yDdgD"
4571,JoeBiden,"It's clear who President Trump works for. He gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he’s cutting food stamp funding for the 3rd time. It’s cruel.

No family should go hungry in America. https://t.co/sy6lGkp1bF"
4572,JoeBiden,"Jill and I are devastated to hear about last night’s shooting in Kansas City. No one should ever have to fear that they, or their loved ones, may not return home due to senseless violence.

We must come together as a country to put an end to these tragedies once and for all."
4573,JoeBiden,"Every day, more evidence is uncovered revealing that Trump is abusing the power of the presidency and is wholly unfit to be president. He is using the highest office in the land to advance his personal, political interests instead of the national interest.
https://t.co/NNpDITpwBV"
4574,JoeBiden,"Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and has saved lives.

4581,JoeBiden,"It has been 219 days since the House passed the bipartisan universal background check bill. Every day since, @senatemajldr McConnell has refused to bring it up for a vote.

4582,JoeBiden,Looking forward to joining @SEIU at the #UnionsForAll Summit this afternoon to talk about my plans to protect and strengthen America’s unions and rebuild the middle class. Tune in: https://t.co/gXE6IEZjvn
4583,JoeBiden,"This is who Donald Trump is.

A president who abuses the power of the Oval Office to win re-election, turns his back on the fight for democracy in Hong Kong, and puts his own self-interest above the public good.

We have to show the world who we are. https://t.co/Bn24RHqQua"

4586,JoeBiden,"I’m not surprised President Trump asked foreign governments for help to beat me and that his special interest friends are spending millions to attack me.

Read my full plan to end gun violence: https://t.co/AbTUKdGwcV https://t.co/pEl8KBvwct"
4590,JoeBiden,"Mr. President, you cannot extort foreign governments to help you win re-election. It’s an abuse of power. It violates your oath of office. And it jeopardizes our national security.

We will end our gun violence epidemic — together. #2020GunSafety https://t.co/khPWpR0FOc"
4595,JoeBiden,"President Trump broke his promise to America's farmers. He campaigned on having their backs, but now his administration is abandoning them and claiming family farms might not survive.
 
I will expand opportunities for our farmers — not count them out. https://t.co/8MHkvP8v6E"
4596,JoeBiden,"52 years ago, Thurgood Marshall became the first African American Supreme Court Justice. A legal giant in the struggle for civil rights—he relentlessly pushed America closer to our promise of liberty, equality, and justice for all. His voice forever changed the course of history."
4597,JoeBiden,"In 1994, Senator Feinstein and I led the fight to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. We took on the @NRA and got it done.

4600,JoeBiden,".@DrBiden and I are sending our best wishes to @BernieSanders, Jane, and the whole Sanders family. Anyone who knows Bernie understands what a force he is. We are confident that he will have a full and speedy recovery and look forward to seeing him on the trail soon."
4601,JoeBiden,President Trump is morally unfit to lead our country. https://t.co/r3SKYqK26K
4602,JoeBiden,"President Trump asked a foreign government to interfere in our elections, and now he's spending $10 million on attack ads against me. It's clear that he is trying to influence the primary and pick his opponent.

Why? Because he knows I’ll beat him like a drum."
4603,JoeBiden,"Weapons of war have no place on our streets.

We must take on the @NRA and ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. I’ve done it before, and I’ll do it again in the White House. https://t.co/hdVTM6YVF7"
4604,JoeBiden,"One of my favorite parts of debate night has become meeting our contest winners from around the country. God love ya, JoAnne. Thanks for coming to Houston.

Congress must hold him accountable."

We must overturn the ban. https://t.co/0aHS6QYcJU

4781,JoeBiden,"Obamacare prohibits insurers from denying coverage for the 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions.

4785,JoeBiden,"Thank you to everyone who joined us in Laconia and New Castle. As I discussed this evening, we’ve got to do everything in our power to end this gun violence epidemic. That starts with passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. https://t.co/4MR5KuQrDd"
4786,JoeBiden,President Trump’s immigration policies are an assault on human dignity and everything we stand for as a nation. We must end them. https://t.co/otwGtLfHyM
4787,JoeBiden,"This is the United States of America. There is not a single thing we have not been able to accomplish once we set our minds to it.

4788,JoeBiden,"The Iran Deal put Iran's nuclear program in a box. Trump walked away from the deal, and now Iran is advancing its program. This is another reminder that Trump's manufactured crisis is making the U.S., the region, and our world less safe. https://t.co/KXD7Bdb5kU"

4790,JoeBiden,"America has stood as a beacon of hope for generations. Now, President Trump wants to slam the door in the face of those fleeing persecution. It's cruel and damages our global standing.

I'll ensure we meet our responsibility as a nation to the world's most vulnerable people. https://t.co/KjBkGlBPpu"
4791,JoeBiden,We all have a responsibility to stand up and speak out when we see abuse of power. Silence is complicity. https://t.co/y03WGsYigi
4792,JoeBiden,"President Trump stokes the flames of hatred, coddles white nationalists with messages of support, and preys on our deepest divisions. If we give him four more years in the White House, he will forever alter the character of our nation.

We can’t let that happen."
4793,JoeBiden,I always enjoy sitting down to chat with my friend @StephenAtHome. Check out a few of my favorite moments from the interview. https://t.co/723faRbi6A
4794,JoeBiden,"President Trump is dead wrong on climate change. We’ve got to choose science over fantasy and treat it like the existential threat that it is.

As president, I would rally the world to take unprecedented action. There would be no empty chair at the G-7. https://t.co/QvLCIM39oV"
4795,JoeBiden,"Two years ago, President Trump attempted to end DACA—throwing lives into chaos &amp; forcing our DREAMers to live in fear as the Supreme Court decides their fate. It's cruel.
 
DREAMers are Americans. It's time for Congress to keep our promise to them &amp; provide a path to citizenship."
4796,JoeBiden,"Despite what the @NRA says, the assault weapons ban that @SenFeinstein and I championed worked. It saved lives.
 
I’ll ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines once again. We will get these weapons of war off our streets. https://t.co/KpXXPzjYjJ"
4797,JoeBiden,"Last night, @StephenAtHome asked me what the defining factor was in my decision to run for president. My answer was clear: Charlottesville. https://t.co/NN335Bxsvk"

4799,JoeBiden,"It’s critical to have a plan to combat climate change, but it’s going to take more than plans — it’s going to take leadership. I have the experience and relationships necessary to rally the world to meet the urgency of this climate crisis. #ClimateTownHall https://t.co/aXvhwUDHMq"

✅ Rejoin the #ParisAgreement on day one and rally the world to go further
✅ Stand up to polluters

#ClimateTownHall https://t.co/7UP1GoZYUv"
4802,JoeBiden,"President Trump continues to:

🔴 Deny the science in front of his own eyes
🔴 Attack the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration

Defeating him is essential to making any progress on climate change. #ClimateTownHall"

4804,JoeBiden,"The clean energy economy of the future presents an enormous opportunity. President Biden will create 10 million well-paying jobs in the United States that will grow a stronger, more inclusive middle class in communities across the country. #ClimateTownHall"
4805,JoeBiden,"The Green New Deal is a crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face. It powerfully captures two core truths:

1️⃣ This is an existential crisis requiring immediate, ambitious action.
2️⃣ Our environment and economy are connected.

#ClimateTownHall"
4806,JoeBiden,"If Joe Biden was president, there would be no empty chair at the G-7. #ClimateTownHall"
4807,JoeBiden,"We can't turn a blind eye to the way in which environmental burdens are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines.

Biden will right these wrongs and stand up to fossil fuel companies  who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities."
4808,JoeBiden,"Here’s the deal: Joe Biden introduced one of the first climate change bills in the Senate, and he’s been at the forefront of the fight ever since.

Don’t just take our word for it, @PolitiFact called Joe Biden a climate change pioneer. #ClimateTownHall

https://t.co/xti5vounyv"
4809,JoeBiden,"On day one as president, Joe Biden will take action to put the United States on track to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions no later than 2050

4812,JoeBiden,"For too long, partisan gerrymandering has allowed politicians to rig the political process and draw districts in their favor. Voters should choose their representatives — not the other way around. https://t.co/RrJvJMcNyR"
4813,JoeBiden,"Looking forward to talking with @StephenAtHome about what’s at stake in this election and why I’m running for president.
 
Tune in to the @colbertlateshow tonight! https://t.co/9gJ4KPSLeL"

https://t.co/9sBLAZysdB"
4815,JoeBiden,"Four years of Betsy DeVos is more than enough.

As president, I’ll name a Secretary of Education who is actually an educator."
4816,JoeBiden,"If those in power fail to take action on gun safety reform we must vote them out. Period.
https://t.co/xTEzC634Ca"
4817,JoeBiden,"This is an important step by Walmart, but we must go further. If we want to end our gun violence epidemic, we must start by passing universal background checks and banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.

It's your turn to act, Senate Republicans. https://t.co/mQvtAJgRei"
4818,JoeBiden,"As I told Pauline yesterday in Iowa, if there are any angels in heaven, they are all nurses. https://t.co/A3rYhsGzok"
4819,JoeBiden,"In America, health care should be a right for all — not a privilege for the few. My plan to protect and build on Obamacare will expand coverage, lower costs, and ensure every American receives the care they need. https://t.co/uw7Kk0ONHA"
4820,JoeBiden,"I've always stood with America's unions, and as president, I'll fight alongside them to protect and strengthen the right to organize and collectively bargain. https://t.co/4VDjf0xqsT"

4823,JoeBiden,Stopped by the Hawkeye Area Labor Council Labor Day Picnic to thank folks for their tireless work fighting for American workers. From fair wages to safe working conditions — we owe our unions so much. https://t.co/1ALkfgImZF
4824,JoeBiden,What a great few days in South Carolina. I’ll be back soon! https://t.co/Wt2tq1Eq13
4825,JoeBiden,"This Labor Day, when you cross paths with someone working a job that makes your day-to-day life better—and I promise you, it will happen many times today—tell them ""thank you.""
 
Tell them you appreciate the work that they do. That it matters to you, and to your community."
4826,JoeBiden,"This Labor Day, we celebrate the battles waged and victories won by organized labor. Unions built the great American middle class, and it’s time we recognize that.

4831,JoeBiden,"I’m heartbroken, sickened, &amp; angry. Weeks after the horror in El Paso, another community in Texas has been terrorized by gun violence. Enough. We must end this epidemic.

@DrBiden &amp; I send our thoughts to those affected &amp; thank our law enforcement who responded at great risk."
4832,JoeBiden,"Obamacare covered 20 million additional Americans, protects over 100 million with pre-existing conditions, and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ coverage until age 26.

We can’t afford to tear it down and start over. We should protect and build on it."
4833,JoeBiden,"On Thursday, 10-year-old Marcus asked me an important question about President Trump. https://t.co/AJeUAXW5ST"
4834,JoeBiden,"Like all bullies, President Trump is trying to make himself seem stronger by picking on the most vulnerable among us — but I would have thought even he would understand that kids with cancer were off-limits.
 
He is morally unfit to lead this country.
https://t.co/nmG7dEwr6Q"
4835,JoeBiden,I’m grateful for the sacrifice Tom made in service to our country. We owe our veterans more than we could ever repay — and it’s our sacred obligation to care for them and their families when they return home. https://t.co/JXpPgGXbqz

4837,JoeBiden,"Our cash bail system disproportionately harms low-income folks and criminalizes poverty. It’s wrong.
 
It’s time we end cash bail and reform our pretrial system by instead putting in place a system that is fair and does not inject further discrimination or bias into the process. https://t.co/Nf9JCgRWxW"
4838,JoeBiden,"I am deeply disappointed that Regal Beloit chose to close its doors and lay off over 150 workers instead of finding a resolution with the @MachinistsUnion. Every worker deserves good wages, affordable health care, and strong workplace protections.
https://t.co/OOTFb1XT3q"
4839,JoeBiden,"Had a great town hall in Greenville yesterday where we discussed our plans increase mental health services in schools &amp; ensure educators are receiving the pay they deserve. Thank you for a great trip, South Carolina! https://t.co/OJfPcIjOy2"
4840,JoeBiden,"I’m looking forward to taking the stage in Houston on September 12th for the next Democratic debate!
 
Folks across the country are coming together and hosting parties in their communities to watch the debate. Sign up to host one in your town: https://t.co/TZzbCCadc7"
4841,JoeBiden,I can’t believe I have to say this: We should not deport children seeking treatment in the U.S. for life-threatening illnesses. https://t.co/7ng4vwHHKg
4842,JoeBiden,"This can’t just be a campaign to beat Donald Trump. This has to be a movement grounded in the values and ideals that define our nation best: honesty, decency, treating everyone with dignity and respect, and giving hate no safe harbor.

That’s who we are as Americans."
4843,JoeBiden,President Trump has found his newest target — sick children. It's sinful. https://t.co/dgFT0vNbYC
4844,JoeBiden,"Grateful to everyone who attended our town hall at Clinton College. As I discussed this morning, we need to stand up to President Trump’s constant attacks on immigrants and end his inhumane policies. We’re stronger because of our diversity — not in spite of it. https://t.co/yo7IxNVI3K"
4845,JoeBiden,"If we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, the planet may never recover. https://t.co/h2N0hn6k6L"

4847,JoeBiden,"It wasn't a setup, I swear. https://t.co/j3lpThTrWh"
4848,JoeBiden,We are running out of words to condemn the inhumanity of this administration. An administration that pulls children from the arms of their parents and stalks families in their neighborhoods will now deport children who are in life-saving treatment for dire conditions like cancer.
4849,JoeBiden,"Our military families sacrifice everything in service to our nation. And today, the Trump Administration revoked automatic citizenship for some of their children.
 
It's reprehensible and cruel. As president, I'll reverse it immediately. https://t.co/WgizSndgMF"
4850,JoeBiden,"Wrapped up our day at Limestone College. I enjoyed hearing from students about the need to reform our criminal justice system and get assault weapons off our streets. I know with these young folks at the helm, America's best days still lie ahead. https://t.co/nJYx1zzlsJ"
4851,JoeBiden,".@SenGillibrand ran a strong, courageous campaign. From championing gender equality to fighting dark money in politics—Senator Gillibrand is always willing to take on the tough fights we face. I know the senator will ensure these issues stay at the center of the national debate. https://t.co/Yhvy8MpALI"
4852,JoeBiden,"56 years ago, the March on Washington and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s “I Have a Dream” speech changed the course of history. As we mark the anniversary, we must reaffirm our commitment to fulfilling America's founding promise. We can't rest until justice truly rings out for all. https://t.co/XrxJQe6yPt"
4853,JoeBiden,Was on the hunt for doughnuts in Spartanburg. Mission accomplished. https://t.co/vLGPdDlGHq
4854,JoeBiden,"64 years ago, 14-year-old Emmett Till was brutally murdered in Mississippi. His death sparked national outrage and served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. It serves as a reminder of the need to reject intolerance in all its forms. We must give hate no safe harbor."
4855,JoeBiden,".@McCreadyForNC is precisely the kind of leader that North Carolina deserves: one who'll put country over party, who's brought jobs to his community, and who will protect coverage for those with preexisting conditions — not dismantle it to cut taxes for the rich."
4856,JoeBiden,"Thank you to everyone who came out to our town hall in Spartanburg, South Carolina! As I shared this afternoon, we need to repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy, make college more affordable, and rebuild America’s middle class. https://t.co/Z1PWPThlTV"
4857,JoeBiden,"I stood before the nation 11 years ago tonight in Denver and accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for vice president. I’m still humbled by the immense trust and faith you placed in President Obama and me.

It’s an evening I’ll never forget. https://t.co/jwxZJCEuBn"
4858,JoeBiden,"President Trump is taking millions from FEMA disaster relief in the midst of hurricane season to further fuel the crisis at the border.

It makes about as much sense as nuking hurricanes.
https://t.co/sAmCB3SKO6"
4859,JoeBiden,"Roe v. Wade is settled law. State laws attacking a woman’s right to choose should be declared unconstitutional. This decision should remain between a woman and her doctor.

4862,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration continues to attack the progress the LGBTQ community has made. As president, passing the Equality Act will be a top legislative priority, because no one should be fired simply because of who they are or whom they love.
https://t.co/X62KbDPTht"
4863,JoeBiden,"American factory workers, farmers, and consumers are the ones paying the price for President Trump’s reckless trade wars—not China. To Trump, the people getting hurt—like those laid off last week in South Carolina—are just pawns in his political games. https://t.co/RRMvVsHrRT"
4864,JoeBiden,"Today, we're launching #StudentsForBiden, a nationwide program for change-makers committed to organizing their campuses and making Donald Trump a one-term president.

4865,JoeBiden,"After three days, we have even more evidence of how President Trump's disastrous foreign policy has left the U.S. isolated. Rather than looking to America for vision, our closest democratic allies sought to manage and mitigate the damage Trump might do at this year's G-7."
4866,JoeBiden,"This ad wasn’t easy for me to record.

Health care is personal to me. Deeply personal. https://t.co/a8UNsnkLhI"
4867,JoeBiden,"The fact of the matter is, the greed of drug companies fueled an opioid epidemic that has ravaged communities in every corner of the country. They should be held accountable for their actions, and this is an important step. https://t.co/sXem3GUt88"
4868,JoeBiden,Happy #InternationalDogDay from Major and camera-shy Champ! https://t.co/haKhxniUYd
4869,JoeBiden,The fires ravaging the Amazon are devastating. The Amazon serves as the lungs of our planet and is home to an invaluable number of plants and animals found nowhere else on Earth.

4870,JoeBiden,"I’m grateful that Gene shared his story. The battle against cancer is personal for me, like it is for so many Americans. But I’m confident — with the power of America’s best minds — we will end cancer as we know it. https://t.co/x5TJ0IHplu"
4871,JoeBiden,"America was built on a simple proposition: all men — and women — are created equal. We haven't lived up to that promise for most, but haven't stopped trying. As we celebrate the 19th Amendment and #WomensEqualityDay, we must continue our fight to truly achieve equality for all."
4872,JoeBiden,"It’s simple—everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. And as I said to Kevin and Michael—LGBTQ rights are civil rights. https://t.co/KSs8lVgrze"

4876,JoeBiden,"A year ago, we lost a true patriot, a hero, and to me—a friend. John McCain's character, courage, and honor made him a giant among all of us. His deep, unshakeable belief in the soul of America and our values inspired us all and provided hope to the world. I miss him every day."

4888,JoeBiden,"It was great to be back with folks at Dartmouth College today for our Health Care Town Hall.

Health care is one of the biggest issues in this election. A Biden administration will ensure health care is a right not a privilege—and give everyone the peace of mind they deserve. https://t.co/rwb70mBHgM"
4889,JoeBiden,A man whose erratic tweets send markets spiraling downward should not be sitting in the Oval Office. https://t.co/8UHEaYlAtI

Thank you @IBEW Local 490 for hosting us! https://t.co/V27ls50iAF"
4892,JoeBiden,"President Trump continues to chip away at the progress made by the Obama-Biden Administration. This time, he’s going after the rules we put in place to decrease vehicle emissions. It's backwards.
 
We need a president who believes in climate change. https://t.co/9P60x0HEwV"
4893,JoeBiden,"Everything workers have that define what it means to live a good life—the 40-hour workweek, paid leave, health care protections, a voice in your workplace safety.
 
It’s all because of unions. It’s time we recognize that. https://t.co/bn4AKmIxu4"
4894,JoeBiden,"We need to take action now to address our climate crisis.

That starts with beating Donald Trump."
4895,JoeBiden,"President Trump just doesn't get it — he claimed his tax cuts jolted the economy and spurred hiring. He was wrong.

I’ll reverse his giveaway to the super-wealthy and invest in rebuilding America's middle class instead.
https://t.co/t5BGWhgIim"
4896,JoeBiden,"New Hampshire, I’m heading your way to talk about our bold vision for the future of the country and how we’ll get it done — together. Head to https://t.co/V0S140bw5w to find an event in your community."

4898,JoeBiden,Building a more inclusive middle class is at the heart of this presidential campaign. That's why I support @Culinary226 and the Station Casino workers who voted to unionize. The will of the workers must be respected and management has to come to the negotiating table immediately.

My sister Valerie is my best friend. Read her full post here: https://t.co/Oq9wlchxID"

Now, he’s in the process of squandering it. https://t.co/A6IXfVSFRx"
4909,JoeBiden,"Once again, President Trump has folded to the @NRA and broken his promise to pursue the most modest of gun safety policies.

4910,JoeBiden,"Mr. President, these comments are insulting and inexcusable—just like your previous dual loyalty insinuations. Stop dividing Americans and disparaging your fellow citizens. It may not be beneath you, but it is beneath the office you hold. https://t.co/THZCPJCY5v"

4912,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration has argued that migrant children held in detention centers don’t need soap, toothbrushes, or beds. Now they’re refusing to provide flu vaccines after three children have already passed away in part from the flu.

It is inhumane.
https://t.co/d34DtefyHL"
4913,JoeBiden,"Our teachers and firefighters should not pay a higher tax rate than Wall Street CEOs. That’s why I’ll repeal President Trump’s tax cuts for the super-wealthy and close capital gains loopholes.

4915,JoeBiden,We will make Donald Trump a one-term president.
4916,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration’s Title X rule is a direct attack on Planned Parenthood and the crucial services the organization provides. Access to health care could be taken away from millions of women. It’s wrong, and as president I will reverse it. https://t.co/6aOXjvwjMK"
4917,JoeBiden,"Extremism is on the rise in America, fueled by a president who has fanned the flames of division and emboldened white nationalists and Neo-Nazis with messages of support.

https://t.co/KCiHIRsYSH"

4920,JoeBiden,"Back in 2007, I had the opportunity to meet with Katie and talk with her about how to overcome a learning disability. Her story has stuck with me ever since. I'm glad we were able to catch up in Iowa, and I'm so proud to hear she has graduated from school. https://t.co/i02zstfkDL"
4921,JoeBiden,"The truth is Obamacare was, and is, a big deal. It covered 20 million additional Americans and protects over 100 million people with pre-existing conditions.

4929,JoeBiden,"President Trump has lied to Iowa farmers at every turn. He promised to ‘unleash ethanol’ but instead all he’s done is secretly unleash Big Oil from its renewable fuel obligations.

I'll support our farmers—not sell them out to the highest bidder.
https://t.co/eTKRnOFjhr"
4930,JoeBiden,"Every day President Trump proves how morally unfit he is to sit in the Oval Office. A president should bring out our best as Americans — not echo schoolyard bullies with taunts based on physical appearance.

4935,JoeBiden,Coal miners have powered our country from the Industrial Revolution to the 21st century. I'm proud to stand with the protesting miners. Blackjewel has an obligation to give its workers the pay and benefits they’ve earned. https://t.co/juuDvLWnKZ
4936,JoeBiden,"Since 1978, CEO compensation has risen 940%, while the average American has seen a raise of just 12%. It’s wrong. We need a $15 minimum wage, stronger labor laws, and a tax code that works for the middle class.

4937,JoeBiden,"Gov. @Hickenlooper ran a strong campaign, talking about the urgent need to rebuild our middle class and standing up to President Trump's trade wars. Coloradans are lucky to have John in their corner, and I look forward to seeing what he does next."
4938,JoeBiden,I have always been a stalwart supporter of Israel—a vital partner that shares our democratic values. No democracy should deny entry to visitors based on the content of their ideas—even ideas they strongly object to. And no leader of the free world should encourage them to do so.
4939,JoeBiden,"Before I was Vice President, before I was a Senator — I started my career as an elected official on the New Castle County Council. Local races matter. I'm proud to sign the @runforsomething pledge to support candidates up and down the ballot to invest in our party’s future."

4944,JoeBiden,"President Trump has emboldened white nationalists with messages of support, called Mexicans ""rapists,"" and told members of Congress to ""go back"" to where they came from.

The words of a president matter. And Trump has used his to unleash the deepest, darkest forces in our nation."
4945,JoeBiden,"This is America, and we are strong and great because of our diversity — not in spite of it. Donald Trump doesn’t get that.

4946,JoeBiden,"I know what it takes to beat the @NRA because I’ve done it twice before. In the Senate, @SenFeinstein and I took on the gun lobby to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and helped pass the Brady background check bill.

4952,JoeBiden,"If we cannot rise to meet this moment, it won’t just be a political failure. It will be a moral one. It will mean that we accept the next inevitable tragedy.

We cannot allow that to happen. We must end our gun violence epidemic. https://t.co/LmiZkk2NDT"
4953,JoeBiden,"There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you worked hard, you were able to share in the prosperity you helped create.

That bargain is broken for American workers, and it's time we restore it. https://t.co/1X8OtXQ3lb"

4967,JoeBiden,"We need gun safety reform &amp; leaders who will step up to get it done. Gov. Sununu instead has decided to stand with President Trump in putting the gun lobby over common-sense reforms that will keep Granite Staters safe.

As president, I’ll take on the NRA &amp; win—again. #NHPolitics"
4968,JoeBiden,"Five years ago, Michael Brown's life was taken in Ferguson. His death stirred the conscience of our nation and awakened a generation of activists. We must ensure justice rings out for all in America — regardless of skin color."
4969,JoeBiden,"At moments when we have been tested most, American presidents have stepped up.

We don’t have that today. We have a president who has aligned himself with the darkest forces in this nation. And that makes winning the battle for the soul of this nation that much harder. https://t.co/7BFSGSUkCu"

https://t.co/0eUEzzUCQJ"
4992,JoeBiden,"Let's be very clear. You use the office of the presidency to encourage and embolden white supremacy. You use words like ""infestation"" and ""invasion"" to talk about human beings.

When people suffering under oppression look to the U.S. for hope, Trump has nothing to offer."

#DemDebate https://t.co/0fMd6DujlO"
5029,JoeBiden,"Under Medicare for All, Americans will see a new type of deductible in their paycheck. Medicare for All costs $30 trillion. Not sure what math they do in New York or California but that would be a lot of money. https://t.co/ifctf8g7pB"
5030,JoeBiden,Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate
5031,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump is the problem with our immigration policy. He's using family separation as a weapon against desperate people seeking safety and a better life.

We need to defeat Donald Trump. #DemDebate"
5032,JoeBiden,Let’s get the facts straight: Medicare for All will cost 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan—and it will be paid for by raising taxes on the middle class. #DemDebate https://t.co/dlyVfenQFg
5033,JoeBiden,"Because of the Affordable Care Act, 20 million Americans gained health insurance. Millions more gained critical protections. But the work isn’t over. As president, Biden won’t rest until everyone has access to the quality, affordable care they deserve. #DemDebate"
5034,JoeBiden,"As Vice President, Biden was a champion for efforts to implement the federal mental health parity law, improve access to mental health care, and eliminate the stigma. 

As president, he'll enforce our mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services."
5035,JoeBiden,Senator Harris’ Medicare for All plan still gets rid of employer-sponsored coverage and still costs 30x more than Joe Biden’s health care plan. Just changing the start date by 6 years doesn’t change the fact it is bad policy. #DemDebate https://t.co/CsBtsTevWE
5036,JoeBiden,I’m running for president to restore the soul of this country...No one man has the capacity to rip that apart. It’s too strong. We're too good. https://t.co/qUDRRuY5Rg
5037,JoeBiden,"In America, health care should be a right for all -- not a privilege for the wealthy few.

Joe Biden’s plan to protect and build on Obamacare is the best way to achieve universal coverage and lower costs: https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C https://t.co/jtA88ylrdp"
5038,JoeBiden,Americans prefer protecting and building on Obamacare with a public option over Medicare for All: https://t.co/tNlPVLG1v8
5039,JoeBiden,"Healthcare is the most important issue to Americans. Senator Harris won't be able to beat Trump with double-talk on healthcare.
We have a plan that builds on the ACA by giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system easier to navigate."
5040,JoeBiden,"Mr. President, this is America. We're stronger because of this diversity, not in spite of it. #DemDebate"

5046,JoeBiden,"A car accident took the lives of my first wife and baby daughter. My family was fortunate to have health insurance, but that's not the case for many.
 
This is why I fight. I believe deeply that health care is a right for all—not a privilege for the few. https://t.co/qsyFHn8jH9"
5047,JoeBiden,"On what would have been his 46th birthday, my thoughts are with the family of my friend Reverend Clementa Pinckney. As we celebrate his life, let's continue on his legacy by living with compassion, kindness, and a relentless dedication to improving the lives of others. https://t.co/qDFArjl5Gb"
5048,JoeBiden,"President Trump &amp; Betsy DeVos continue to roll back our progress on LGBTQ rights. No child should feel unsafe in school because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

A Biden administration will ensure all of our young people are affirmed &amp; accepted exactly as they are. https://t.co/P9j6zoCFwz"
5049,JoeBiden,"54 years ago, President Johnson signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. This landmark legislation changed the lives of millions by providing the peace of mind that comes with quality, affordable health care."
5050,JoeBiden,"I’m grateful to Joe and Michelle for sharing their story and glad to hear Matthew is receiving the treatment he needs.

5052,JoeBiden,"Two years ago, President Trump gave giant tax cuts to the super-wealthy and corporations. Now, he wants to rip free school lunches away from kids who need help the most. It’s heartless. No kid should go hungry in America. https://t.co/TybdVnFjLH"
5053,JoeBiden,"We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to stop America’s gun violence epidemic — that starts with taking on the powerful gun lobby and passing common-sense gun safety laws.

I’ve beaten the @NRA twice. And I’ll do it again in the White House."
5054,JoeBiden,The Affordable Care Act changed the life of @DrBiden’s sister — like it did millions of Americans — by giving her access to the health care she needed. We can’t afford to start over. https://t.co/ixdpu8bQGv
5055,JoeBiden,.@TheRevAl is a champion in the fight for civil rights. The fact that President Trump continues to use the power of the presidency to unleash racist attacks on the people he serves is despicable. This hate has no place in our country. It's beneath the dignity of the office.
5056,JoeBiden,"Iowa, I have some big news: @DrBiden is heading your way on August 1st to open two of our field offices. Join her in Sioux City: https://t.co/h1olJlsQuc or Council Bluffs: https://t.co/1PoR8mdfT2. https://t.co/79BfOWQrIh"

5058,JoeBiden,"This violence is not normal. How many more families will have to lose a loved one before we fix our broken gun laws? We must take action, starting with real reform.

Our thoughts are with everyone in Gilroy this evening. Enough is enough. https://t.co/wHqY9RE8Nu"
5059,JoeBiden,"Instead of starting from scratch, we need to build on the Affordable Care Act. I'll expand on the progress we made—giving Americans more choice, reducing health care costs, and making our health care system less complex to navigate.

Read my full plan at https://t.co/gm6jgUINzt"
5060,JoeBiden,"Far too often, students who experience mental health problems do not get the care they need. As President, I will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve.
https://t.co/hHruW4wDtx"

5063,JoeBiden,"Since the historic passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congressional Republicans have been fighting to it tear down. Two years ago today, they continued their crusade in an attempt to pass a “skinny repeal” of Obamacare—it failed."
5064,JoeBiden,"Trump’s trade wars are squeezing American farmers. In states like South Dakota—where agriculture is a top industry—effects go well beyond farms. As president, I'd join together with our allies &amp; stand up to China to ensure our policies work for our farmers.https://t.co/CEm0IRZIg0"
5065,JoeBiden,.@RepCummings is one of the finest people I’ve ever served with. It is despicable for you to attack him and the people of Baltimore this way. Once again you have proved yourself unfit to hold the office. A President is supposed to lift this nation up. Not tear it down.
5066,JoeBiden,"Here’s the deal: I will oppose every effort by Republicans, Democrats, &amp; anyone else seeking to tear down Obamacare. It is imperative that we build upon the progress we've made by protecting the Affordable Care Act. Read my plan at https://t.co/IwFG48ED9h 
https://t.co/BaLX1VRWZo"
5067,JoeBiden,"A border wall is the physical embodiment of @realDonaldTrump’s inability to develop effective immigration policy.

His use of Department of Defense funds for the wall is a phony answer to the real challenges we face—and he knows it. https://t.co/JAhysdhNd8"
5068,JoeBiden,"Climate change is an existential threat to our planet. As President, not only will I recommit us to the Paris Agreement—I’ll lead an effort for every major emitting country to ramp up the ambition of their domestic climate targets. 
https://t.co/1aKhXI1FPY"
5069,JoeBiden,We can't be blind to the way environmental burdens—like air pollution—are distributed unevenly along racial and socioeconomic lines. https://t.co/74pGl6etPp
5070,JoeBiden,"I've always been proud to have cosponsored the Americans with Disabilities Act, signed into law 29 years ago.

5071,JoeBiden,"Earlier this week, @DrBiden,@RepRichmond, and I had the opportunity to spend some time with the great folks at @YEPNOLA in New Orleans, Louisiana. It was great getting to see the work they’re doing to inspire the children in their community. https://t.co/hubDMkr8bm"
5072,JoeBiden,The marine transit system in Alaska is vital to rural communities—but faces draconian cuts in funding. IBU is on strike to ensure this lifeline for Alaskans will continue to serve communities from Ketchikan to Kodiak. The governor must restore full funding immediately. @ILWU
5073,JoeBiden,"Trump is fighting tooth &amp; nail to deny those fleeing dangerous situations their right to seek asylum in our nation. We should uphold our moral responsibility &amp; enforce our immigration laws with dignity—not turn away those fleeing violence, war, &amp; poverty. 
https://t.co/1CVPP3sJo3"
5074,JoeBiden,"Trump’s tariff war with China is crushing American farmers. It's easy to talk tough when someone else feels the pain. We need to be tough AND smart—working with allies to curb China’s abusive trade practices, not isolating us from our closest partners. https://t.co/pY75vyEFn3"
5075,JoeBiden,"Let's call Trump’s travel ban what it is: a disgrace. We are a nation of immigrants, and we need a leader who recognizes that our diversity is our greatest asset. https://t.co/YLkEI4xHb2"
5076,JoeBiden,"Like so many other Americans, Marcy prefers to keep her private insurance while recognizing that a public health insurance option is necessary for some of her friends and family. https://t.co/1PnfSGC5WC"
5077,JoeBiden,"Since 1973, over 160 individuals in this country have been sentenced to death and were later exonerated. Because we can’t ensure that we get these cases right every time, we must eliminate the death penalty. 
https://t.co/o9LQHWwmt7"
5078,JoeBiden,Had the opportunity to discuss my plans to advance equity and opportunity for communities of color all across the nation today at the @NatUrbanLeague Conference in Indianapolis. Thank you for having me! https://t.co/m7s2Mjw671

5082,JoeBiden,"Denali's death marks the 3rd murder of a trans woman in South Carolina this year.

Violence against the transgender community is an epidemic—crimes are occurring far too often. It's our moral obligation to put an end to violence in our communities. 

https://t.co/cW4gRobK3M"
5083,JoeBiden,"Russia undermined our democracy by interfering in the 2016 election. That's a fact. We need a President who will stand up to the Kremlin, push back against Putin, and take immediate steps to ensure the security of our elections."

Read our plan: https://t.co/FWDpnciYM8 https://t.co/ShIE1GsEun"

5092,JoeBiden,"We currently have insufficient data to eliminate racial &amp; ethnic biases in our criminal justice system. As president, I’ll urge states to add info regarding ethnicity to their data collection to understand how groups—like Latinx—interact with the system. https://t.co/fsdoT4QPAb"
5093,JoeBiden,"We must reform our juvenile justice system to give children a second chance to live up to their potential.

5145,JoeBiden,It’s young people like the @NHYoungDems that give me so much hope and excitement for the future of our country. https://t.co/DcsbEFGpVS
5146,JoeBiden,President Trump’s ICE raids are inhumane. His scare tactics solve nothing. We shouldn't be terrorizing communities and splitting up families. We should provide a pathway to citizenship and find a lasting solution.
5147,JoeBiden,I’m heartbroken to hear of the passing of Héctor Figueroa. Héctor was a stalwart champion in the fight to ensure every worker receives the respect and dignity they’ve earned. My thoughts are with his family and his loved ones.
5148,JoeBiden,"Had the opportunity to spend some time with the great residents of Atkinson, New Hampshire, today. Thank you all for the warm welcome into your community! https://t.co/A2HLYUh3Li"
5149,JoeBiden,"As individuals, and as a nation, we have to prove to the world that the United States is prepared to lead—not just with the example of our power, but the power of our example.

I will take decisive steps to renew our core American values and return transparency to our government. https://t.co/A13K4rrAtQ"

5155,JoeBiden,"Today in New York City, I laid out my foreign policy vision for America. A vision built on restoring dignified leadership at home and respected leadership on the world stage."

5157,JoeBiden,"Embracing dictators. Threatening war. Embarrassing the United States.

That’s the #TrumpDoctrine.

Reclaiming American leadership starts now. https://t.co/8BQv50aseA"
5158,JoeBiden,"Today, we celebrate Journeyman Lineman Recognition Day and the work @IBEW does to keep lineworkers safe. These brave men and women do the hard work of powering America’s electric grid, economy, and future. Our country can't function without the important work they do."
5159,JoeBiden,"Our campaign starts at the local level — neighbors talking with neighbors and organizing their communities in every corner of the country. If you’re ready to get to work, sign up to host an organizing meeting for our nationwide Day of Action on July 20th: https://t.co/6KVUlaLEPb"
5160,JoeBiden,"President Trump can avoid talking about climate change all he wants, but it doesn’t change the fact that it is real, is here, and requires our urgent action.

We can't afford four more years of a climate change denier in the White House.
https://t.co/iI3P17wRlE"
5161,JoeBiden,"New Hampshire, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk about our plans to rebuild the backbone of the country — the middle class. Head to https://t.co/G6YWOs7Oxu to find an event in your community. Hope to see you there!"

We can get there — together. https://t.co/TmREN4zy74"
5165,JoeBiden,Here’s what I commit to you: I will name a Secretary of Education who is an educator. https://t.co/FC37ZMAKAr
5166,JoeBiden,"The abuse of a child is one of the most heinous, despicable abuses of power imaginable. It is inexcusably poor judgment for a US Attorney to seek leniency for someone guilty of it. Secretary Acosta should provide his resignation immediately."
5167,JoeBiden,"Today, the Affordable Care Act is back in the courts — putting the health care of millions of Americans at risk. It’s clear some will stop at nothing to sabotage Obamacare and roll back the progress we’ve made. https://t.co/7SEAx4HZrd"
5168,JoeBiden,"Thank you to everyone at our town hall discussion in Charleston, South Carolina, for your thoughtful questions on ending gun violence, combating the opioid epidemic, and ensuring every American has access to quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/Dbabofnq4v"
5169,JoeBiden,".@EricSwalwell ran a passionate campaign, and I commend him for bringing more attention to the urgent need for gun safety reform in America."
5170,JoeBiden,"It was the honor of my lifetime to serve with a man who I believe was a great president, a historic figure, and most important to me, a close friend.

He selected me. I’ll take his judgment about my record, my character, and my ability to handle the job over anyone else’s. https://t.co/XoZJhNl6xX"

5172,JoeBiden,I had the opportunity to meet Cameron Boyce at this year’s Courage Awards and through his work with @ItsOnUs.

5179,JoeBiden,"No child’s future should be determined by their gender, race, zip code, parents' income, or disability. Full stop. In a Biden administration, we’ll make historic investments in our public schools to ensure every kid in America gets a fair shot. #StrongPublicSchools https://t.co/1qxnhs3D9H"
5180,JoeBiden,Thank you to @NEAToday for a great discussion this afternoon on how we can work together to create #StrongPublicSchools. I can promise you that @DrBiden and I will be the best partners and fiercest advocates in the White House for America’s educators and students. #NEARA19 https://t.co/kKzTLlunk7
5181,JoeBiden,Had the opportunity to meet some incredible Iowans at yesterday’s parade in Independence. Thank you to everyone who came out to celebrate the #FourthOfJuly and the values that this country stands for. https://t.co/MS3OTbNLXH
5182,JoeBiden,"Looking forward to joining @NEAToday to discuss my plan for #StrongPublicSchools. I know from watching @DrBiden all these years that, for educators, their profession isn’t just what they do, it’s who they are — and it’s time we support them with the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/LdR17BGTZu"
5183,JoeBiden,.@DrBiden and I had a great time celebrating the #FourthOfJuly at last night's @IowaCubs game! https://t.co/EU0zCBybCa
5184,JoeBiden,"I had the opportunity to congratulate some newly minted U.S. citizens in Des Moines, Iowa. Tonight’s naturalization ceremony — on the anniversary of our independence — serves as a reminder that being a nation of immigrants is one of our greatest strengths. #FourthOfJuly https://t.co/YbxD36sPRm"
5185,JoeBiden,"We just wrapped up a great event in Marshalltown, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us on this #FourthOfJuly! https://t.co/z6mHBLcPWQ"
5186,JoeBiden,What will Donald Trump say this evening when he speaks to the nation at an event designed more to stroke his ego than celebrate American ideals? Will he speak to the example America must set to inspire the world?
5187,JoeBiden,"243 years ago, a group of rebels in Philadelphia pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to a revolutionary idea, to the self-evident truth that all men — and women — are created equal."
5188,JoeBiden,"It’s fitting that we’re celebrating Independence Day in Independence, Iowa. Thank you to everyone who said hello at this morning’s #FourthOfJuly parade — it was great to see so many supporters! https://t.co/tEOXY8wLAn"
5189,JoeBiden,"America is an idea — stronger than any army, more powerful than any dictator. It gives hope to the most desperate people on Earth. Instills in us the belief that no matter where you start in life, there's nothing you can't achieve.

That's worth celebrating. Happy #FourthofJuly"
5190,JoeBiden,Thank you to everyone who came out to our event in Waterloo! RSVP to join us tomorrow in Independence and Marshalltown: https://t.co/PyvclvDFPY https://t.co/oEwfwHez3A
5191,JoeBiden,DREAMers—young people who came to the U.S. as children—are Americans. They don’t deserve to sit in limbo as the Supreme Court decides whether President Trump can end the Obama-Biden DACA policy. Congress should act now to give them a path to citizenship. https://t.co/4teULJvgki
5192,JoeBiden,"South Carolina, I’m heading your way this weekend to talk with you about how we’ll build an inclusive middle class where everyone comes along. Head to https://t.co/ie4M0dWVIR to RSVP for an event in your community."
5193,JoeBiden,"Rooms of people packed body to body. Kids being held without access to showers or a change of clothes. It’s simply abhorrent.

We all have a moral obligation to keep speaking out until this administration ends these inhumane policies once and for all. https://t.co/KrxqXcHV9p"
5194,JoeBiden,"John Walsh was an incredible coach and mentor. He always urged us to play the game and live our lives with passion and integrity. @DrBiden and I are sending our prayers to his family — he will be dearly missed.
https://t.co/37HRxXC80i"
5195,JoeBiden,"Tomorrow, I’m heading to Iowa with @DrBiden to talk with voters about our bold vision for the future. We hope you’ll come out and join us! Head to https://t.co/jXap7UviAc to RSVP. https://t.co/XoOuhxbqBB"
5196,JoeBiden,"Today marks 55 years since the signing of the Civil Rights Act — the landmark piece of legislation that brought our nation closer to fulfilling the promise that was made two centuries earlier in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A promise of equality, equity, and fairness for all."
5197,JoeBiden,"The Department of Commerce just announced the 2020 Census will not have President Trump’s citizenship question. This is not only a victory for immigrants and Latinos, but for all Americans. Everyone deserves to be counted and have their voices heard without fear."
5198,JoeBiden,"Luis Alvarez was an American hero—@DrBiden and I are sending our thoughts and prayers to his family.

No one should have to spend their final weeks fighting for the health care and benefits they deserve. We must do better for our 9/11 first responders. https://t.co/UkMAdNFXVI"
5199,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake, this is a modern-day poll tax that overturns the will of Florida voters. It’s unacceptable.
 
We must ensure everyone — including individuals formerly incarcerated for felonies — has the right to make their voices heard at the ballot box. https://t.co/s8dFgr0mVm"
5200,JoeBiden,"One in five students experience mental health problems, but too often they don’t get the care they need. In a Biden administration, we will double the number of mental health professionals in schools to give our kids the support they deserve. https://t.co/tGh2Rgd9MX"
5201,JoeBiden,"Income inequality is on the rise — made worse by the Trump tax cut that was a giant giveaway to the super-wealthy. We’ve got to rebuild the backbone of this country — the middle class.
 
That starts by rewarding work, not just wealth."
5202,JoeBiden,"Yet again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he is more concerned with a photo op for himself than getting results for the American people. He has repeatedly elevated Kim Jong Un — a murderous tyrant — on the international stage in exchange for almost nothing."
5203,JoeBiden,"President Trump’s failure to lead on the climate crisis is inexcusable — it endangers the future of our country and planet.

As president, I’ll rejoin the #ParisAgreement and rally the world to push our progress further and faster.
https://t.co/CSABVSltRW"
5204,JoeBiden,"If we want to make Donald Trump a one-term president, it’s going to take everyone stepping up and pitching in what they can. Will you make a donation before our big public fundraising deadline tonight? https://t.co/BWLrzM9AE6"
5205,JoeBiden,"This week, I’m heading back to Iowa to talk with voters about why I’m running for president and my bold vision for the future. Head to https://t.co/8fR5oV96xe to RSVP to an event in your community. Hope to see you there!"
5206,JoeBiden,"I’ve seen firsthand how hard America’s educators work for little pay and few resources. They deserve better. In a Biden administration, we’ll support our educators by giving them the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/tGh2RfVyon"
5207,JoeBiden,We’re relying on the support of grassroots donors across the country to power this campaign — not corporate PACs or lobbyists. Will you chip in before tonight’s end-of-quarter deadline? https://t.co/h2fvoyS16A
5208,JoeBiden,"Meeting the newest member of the Biden family today. Congratulations to my niece and nephew. This is what it’s all about. Welcome to the world, sweet Valerie Jean. https://t.co/TfjGjkp8jR"
5209,JoeBiden,"Yesterday’s verdict doesn’t take away the pain or the loss of Heather Heyer on that day in Charlottesville, but is hopefully a step toward healing and a sense of justice. https://t.co/CZLYSTUtMC"
5210,JoeBiden,"The same forces of hatred rooted in 'birtherism' that questioned @BarackObama's American citizenship, and even his racial identity, are now being used against Senator @KamalaHarris. It’s disgusting and we have to call it out when we see it. Racism has no place in America."
5211,JoeBiden,"We're in a battle for the soul of this nation. We can end the politics of division that’s pulling this country apart and move forward again ⁠— but it’s going to take everyone rolling up their sleeves and doing their part.

Let's get to work. https://t.co/Q3Y1el5tOY"
5212,JoeBiden,"Today marks 50 years since the Stonewall uprising, where those brave individuals took a stand on Christopher St and changed our world forever. We must continue our fight for full LGBTQ equality until everyone is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. #Stonewall50 https://t.co/9X8zf8xWBN"
5213,JoeBiden,"I’ve fought my heart out to ensure that civil rights, voting rights, and equal rights are enforced everywhere. These rights are not up to the states to decide. They are embedded in our Constitution. And the federal government has a duty to protect the civil rights of all people. https://t.co/2vMqzRrg89"
5214,JoeBiden,"At last night’s first Democratic debate, I laid out why I’m running for president and my bold vision for the future. A vision built on uniting our country, because there's not a single thing the American people can’t do — together. #DemDebate https://t.co/jzfVUZ5T2x"
5215,JoeBiden,"I just got off the debate stage, where I laid out my vision for the country. We’ll work together to get it done, because there’s not a single thing we can’t do – together. If you agreed with what you heard tonight, join our team and let’s get to work: https://t.co/2LMjeCxvEs"

5235,JoeBiden,"Hey everyone — @TeamJoe here! We’re taking over @JoeBiden’s account while he’s on stage for tonight’s Democratic debate. Throughout the evening, we’ll be giving you the facts on Joe and his record. #DemDebate"
5236,JoeBiden,"In an hour, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. As I’ve said from day one, I’m running for president for three reasons: to restore the soul of this nation, rebuild its backbone — the middle class, and unify all Americans."
5237,JoeBiden,"From day one, we've refused to take money from any corporate PACs or lobbyists. Today, I’m building on that base by signing @NoFossilMoney’s pledge to reject support from the PACs, lobbyists, or executives of fossil fuel companies.

I work for you — not any industry. https://t.co/f8HxB89F9V"
5238,JoeBiden,"In America, every worker deserves fair treatment, safe workplaces, and the right to join a union. Period. I’m proud to stand in solidarity with airport workers across the country as they strike for their right to organize. #RespectUSworkers"
5239,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake, the Trump Administration added a citizenship question to the Census to deliberately cut out the voices of immigrants and communities of color. It’s wrong and goes against our core values as a nation."
5240,JoeBiden,Today the Supreme Court refused to stop politicians rigging our democracy by writing election rules for their own benefit. It couldn’t have happened without Justices put there by Donald Trump and Republicans — another reason why Democrats must take back the White House in 2020.
5241,JoeBiden,"I was proud to sign @IndivisibleTeam’s pledge. Our large and diverse set of qualified Democratic candidates is evidence of our strength as a party, and I am committed to supporting whomever becomes the nominee. The most important thing is to beat Donald Trump. Period. https://t.co/KiBiOOZpDm"
5242,JoeBiden,"All marriages, at their root, are about love. And four years ago, the Supreme Court affirmed that simple proposition in Obergefell v. Hodges. Thank you to the generations of LGBTQ trailblazers who refused to bend before the voices of intolerance. Your courage changed the world."
5243,JoeBiden,This image is gut-wrenching. The cruelty we're seeing at our border is unconscionable. History will judge how we respond to the Trump Administration’s treatment of immigrant families &amp; children—we can’t be silent. This isn't who we are. This is not America.https://t.co/ZeMBmwUHxU
5244,JoeBiden,"One year ago, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's Muslim ban—one of this administration's most egregious attacks on our core values. Wielding the politics of fear and intolerance by slandering entire religious communities as complicit in terrorism is wrong, and it’s not who we are."
5245,JoeBiden,"DREAMers are Americans, and Congress needs to make it official. The millions of DREAMers and undocumented individuals in the United States can only be brought out of the shadows through fair treatment, not ugly threats."
5246,JoeBiden,"In two days, I’ll take the stage for the first Democratic debate to discuss my vision for the country. If you haven’t yet, RSVP to attend a watch party in your community today: https://t.co/ai8Gixr1tV https://t.co/o5pV6OJN76"

5248,JoeBiden,"Civil rights was one of the things that got me engaged in politics. Six years after Shelby County v. Holder, voting rights are under attack across the country. And that’s one of the reasons I’m running for president today.

We must renew our efforts to protect the right to vote. https://t.co/IXrZ8dJWRq"
5249,JoeBiden,"We must secure our borders, but “build the wall” is a slogan divorced from reality. We need to focus on improving screening procedures at our legal ports of entry &amp; making smart investments in border technology. These policies will do more for our security than a wall ever could."
5250,JoeBiden,.@GabbyGiffords’ dedication to making our communities safer continues to be an inspiration. I join her in urging the Senate to vote on #BackgroundChecksNow. We must take on the @NRA and end the epidemic of gun violence in our country. https://t.co/XqRzkRe2KY

5254,JoeBiden,"The Trump Administration is arguing in the 9th Circuit that migrant children held in detention centers without soap, toothbrushes or beds are in conditions that are “safe and sanitary”.

It’s an all-out assault on human dignity and our standards as a nation. We must do better."
5255,JoeBiden,"Trump’s erratic, impulsive actions are the last thing we need as Commander-in-Chief. No president should order a military strike without fully understanding the consequences. We don’t need another war in the Middle East, but Trump’s actions toward Iran only make that more likely."
5256,JoeBiden,"I support @PPact because women and transgender individuals' health care is essential. Historically, women — and particularly women of color — have been put in a position where they cannot access health care, in a more extreme way more than any other part of the population."
5257,JoeBiden,It’s always great to be back at the #ClyburnFishFry. Thank you to @ClyburnSC06 and everyone who came out for a great night! https://t.co/SMkY7XgZ7L
5258,JoeBiden,"President Trump continues to deny the scientific evidence in front of his own eyes and attack the progress we’ve made on climate change. It’s unacceptable.

5260,JoeBiden,"We have to take on the epidemic of violence against the transgender community — especially trans women of color. Ten trans women have been killed violently in 2019 so far.

We must stand up, speak out, and put an end to this hate. https://t.co/FxW38cG6xQ"
5261,JoeBiden,This month marks 50 years since a movement was born on Christopher Street — a movement that has delivered so much acceptance &amp; hope &amp; pride for the LGBTQ community. I stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the uprising that changed our world forever. https://t.co/i2ShQVIKjm
5262,JoeBiden,President Trump's Iran strategy is a self-inflicted disaster. Two of America's vital interests in the Middle East are preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and securing a stable energy supply through the Strait of Hormuz. Trump is failing on both counts.
5263,JoeBiden,"America was founded on the ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness—but has failed to live up to that promise for all people. In 2019, the unemployment rate for black people is almost twice that of white people. Children born poor are twice as likely to stay poor if they’re black."
5264,JoeBiden,President Trump threatening the mass deportation of immigrants is cruel and un-American. We can fix our broken immigration system and enforce our laws without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/0NE6CitDKM
5265,JoeBiden,"Hey there - @TeamJoe here. President Trump dismisses everything he doesn’t want to hear as “FAKE NEWS” -- so as he announces his re-election, we want to make sure you have the real facts on his record:"
5266,JoeBiden,"For all the hard-won progress, for as much as we can celebrate how much better things have gotten — this fight is not over.

We have to come together to stand up to abuses of power, ensure that everyone is treated with dignity, and fight for full equality. https://t.co/aCoWE0hggC"
5267,JoeBiden,Stopped by @TheStonewallNYC to celebrate #PrideMonth &amp; #WorldPride where the movement began 50 years ago. https://t.co/2Z4PyfzyOq
5268,JoeBiden,It’s past time for a $15 minimum wage. https://t.co/PQf5I3Qxzp
5269,JoeBiden,"I’ll be taking the stage at 9PM ET on June 27 for the first Democratic debate!

We’re organizing debate watch parties in every corner of the country for the big night and need your help. Sign up to host one in your community: https://t.co/3TRBR6Fz8i"
5270,JoeBiden,"This weekend, I’m heading to South Carolina for the @SCDP Convention and world-famous #ClyburnFishFry! RSVP to come out and join us: https://t.co/r0RlGVVUmE"
5271,JoeBiden,"Under President Trump’s policies, a four-month-old was separated from his family at the border. It’s unconscionable and fundamentally at odds with everything our nation stands for.

America is better than this. https://t.co/hQY3xISf7r"
5272,JoeBiden,"Happy anniversary to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. I’m forever grateful you agreed to spend the rest of your life with me. I love you, Jilly! https://t.co/HwCQIjFc4J"
5273,JoeBiden,"I was honored to join @UniteThePoor, @RevDrBarber, and @liztheo at today’s #PPCMoralCongress Presidential Forum."
5274,JoeBiden,"Today, I took @EricHolder's @demredistrict pledge to support #FairMaps. For too long, gerrymandering has allowed politicians to pick who they represent. That’s wrong. I’m committed to fair redistricting where elected officials are accountable to those they represent."
5275,JoeBiden,"Four years ago, a white supremacist walked into ""Mother Emanuel"" and gunned down nine brave souls, including my friend Clementa Pinckney. It's not enough to remember them. We have to fight for them. We are in a battle for the soul of this nation."
5276,JoeBiden,"7 years ago, @BarackObama and I offered security to DREAMers, young people brought here as kids who only know America as home. Trump is trying to break our country's promise to them &amp; continues to threaten their status.

DREAMers are Americans. It’s time we kept our word to them."
5277,JoeBiden,"Good luck to the @USWNT as they take on Chile! 

As we cheer them on in the World Cup, we must support their fight off the field for equal pay. In 2019, it’s past time we close the pay gap and ensure women get paid as much as men. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/bJQZm2aQMv"
5278,JoeBiden,"As my father believed, there’s no higher calling for a woman or a man than to be a good mother or a good father. Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there who work every day to help raise their children—and all our children—to be honorable, generous, kind young men and women. https://t.co/6B8hbfOIft"
5279,JoeBiden,"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers, CEOs, or hedge fund managers. It was built by the American middle class. It’s time we recognize that.

We’ve got to build an economy and a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth."
5280,JoeBiden,"In America, no child’s future should be determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. In a Biden Administration, we’ll invest in our students, schools, and educators to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Read the plan here: https://t.co/d1o4WnUNrt"
5281,JoeBiden,"The extraordinary bravery shown by hundreds of thousands in Hong Kong, marching for the civil liberties &amp; autonomy promised by China is inspiring. And the world is watching. All of us must stand in support of democratic principles and freedom."
5282,JoeBiden,"Donald Trump doesn’t think it matters if candidates accept damaging intel on their opponent from a foreign government. He’s dead wrong.

That’s why I’m signing the Pledge for Election Integrity. I refuse to help those who seek to undermine our democracy. https://t.co/Zw7DKYXc1h https://t.co/3NGezt58hx"
5283,JoeBiden,Every worker in this country deserves the dignity that comes with fair wages and benefits — and the right to collectively bargain. I’m proud to stand with Detroit security officers today as they fight for a $15 minimum wage and union rights. #OneDetroit
5284,JoeBiden,"Had great pancakes and great conversation at Tasty Cafe in Eldridge before heading to Clinton Community College for our final event this trip. Thank you for a great few days, Iowa! https://t.co/gONhYR1gRf"
5285,JoeBiden,"I have nothing against Amazon, but no company pulling in billions of dollars of profits should pay a lower tax rate than firefighters and teachers. We need to reward work, not just wealth. https://t.co/R6xaN3vXGT"
5286,JoeBiden,President Trump is once again welcoming foreign interference in our elections. This isn’t about politics. It is a threat to our national security. An American President should not seek their aid and abet those who seek to undermine democracy.
5287,JoeBiden,We had a great day in Iowa talking about how we rebuild the backbone of our country — the middle class. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! https://t.co/49jUzP89F1
5288,JoeBiden,"Today in 1967, the Supreme Court struck down interracial marriage bans in Loving v. Virginia—a decision that inched us closer to our founding ideals of equality, equity, &amp; fairness.

The decision reminds us progress doesn’t happen on its own—every generation has to fight for it."
5289,JoeBiden,"Our 9/11 first responders represent the best of our country — selflessly rushing into danger to save others. We owe them so much, and the least we can do is provide the health care and benefits they deserve. 

Thank you, Jon Stewart, for continuing to have their backs. https://t.co/AHvAupqIyc"
5290,JoeBiden,"Three years later, the horrific attack on Pulse Nightclub still shakes our nation to the core. A night that should have been a celebration of love and life was cut short by unspeakable terror. Today, we remember those we lost — including so many in the LGBTQ community. https://t.co/vdNyZEjlRr"
5291,JoeBiden,President Trump thinks his tariffs are being paid by China. Just like he thinks Mexico is building the wall.
5292,JoeBiden,"Tomorrow, we’re heading to Clinton, Iowa, and hope to see you there! RSVP at https://t.co/MwCakzlMdm and spread the word to family and friends."
5293,JoeBiden,President Trump is bringing his secret one page agreement with Mexico to Iowa. The Iowans being crushed by his tariffs would like to see it.
5294,JoeBiden,Good luck to the @USWNT as they kick off their first game of the Women’s World Cup. @DrBiden and I will be rooting for you! We have no doubt you’ll make our country proud. #OneNationOneTeam https://t.co/BCtOFAtSRt
5295,JoeBiden,Tune in here: https://t.co/4rTMVjJzyb
5296,JoeBiden,"Hey everyone, @TeamJoe here. We’re taking over to keep you in the loop on our event in Ottumwa, Iowa. Stay tuned! #TeamJoe"

5298,JoeBiden,It was great to be back in Atlanta! Thank you to Mayor @KeishaBottoms for showing me around town and for your work expanding opportunity to every corner of the city. https://t.co/kmhmeN5lHm
5299,JoeBiden,"President Trump’s decision to abandon the #ParisAgreement wasn't just reckless—it abdicated our leadership on the world stage and threatened the future of our planet.
 
On day one, I’ll rejoin the Agreement and rally the world to push our progress further. https://t.co/0Wxk0RIYvs"
5300,JoeBiden,"Jill &amp; I were thrilled to be there today to watch our amazing granddaughter Maisy graduate. Maisy, you make us so proud &amp; we can’t wait to see what you do next with your talent, smarts, dedication and kindness. The future is yours, and Nana &amp; Pop will always be right behind you. https://t.co/zj80Kee4l3"
5301,JoeBiden,"As president, I’ll lead America to become the world’s clean energy superpower.

https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo https://t.co/rzeIcuW9BW"
5302,JoeBiden,"Happy birthday to one of the strongest people Jill and I know, @GabbyGiffords. You are an inspiration to so many people. Your courage and your advocacy have made our country a better place."
5303,JoeBiden,"Happy #BestFriendsDay to my friend, @BarackObama. https://t.co/JTd1t7NtyL"
5304,JoeBiden,The Bidens are celebrating my daughter Ashley’s birthday today. @DrBiden and I are so proud of everything she has accomplished and can’t wait to see what she achieves in the years ahead. https://t.co/XlUZHSBMKp
5305,JoeBiden,"Across America, mayors are stepping up and leading the way on combating climate change. Thank you to @MartyForBoston for showing me the innovative work Boston is doing to protect the city from rising sea levels and increased flooding. https://t.co/LZKp6WNWlj"
5306,JoeBiden,"Iowa, we’re heading your way next week and hope to see you there! Go to https://t.co/r0RlGWdvLe to RSVP to an event in your community."
5307,JoeBiden,"Make no mistake, how we act in the next 12 years will determine the very livability of our planet. We’ll make the largest investment in American history to tackle the climate emergency head on and protect our planet for future generations. https://t.co/XJsdFWUo9j"
5308,JoeBiden,"This campaign is about listening to communities and working with them to find solutions to the issues on their minds. Yesterday we held a roundtable to do just that.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories with me in Atlanta. https://t.co/xSyn19iT7L"
5309,JoeBiden,"Today is #NationalGunViolenceAwarenessDay. Our team, and people across the country, are wearing orange in remembrance of the countless lives that have been cut short by senseless acts of gun violence in America."
5310,JoeBiden,"Women’s rights and health care are under assault in a way that seeks to roll back every step of progress we’ve made over the last 50 years. If I believe health care is a right, as I do, I can no longer support an amendment that makes that right dependent on someone’s zip code."
5311,JoeBiden,"75 years ago, far from home, on those bloody beachheads of Normandy, thousands of brave young Americans risked everything to prove that freedom, justice, and democracy would never bend before the forces of fascism and intolerance."
5312,JoeBiden,"We can’t afford four more years of President Trump attacking the progress we’ve made on climate change. On day one as president, I’ll take the bold action necessary to tackle this crisis head on. https://t.co/PTXHzn1PXM"
5313,JoeBiden,We had a great few days on the campaign trail in New Hampshire. Thank you to everyone who came out to join us! I look forward to being back soon. https://t.co/oQA6EhBT5f
5314,JoeBiden,"Spent yesterday afternoon in Plymouth, NH, discussing how we build our Clean Energy Revolution. Under our bold new plan, the United States will be a 100% clean-energy economy with net-zero emissions by 2050.

Read more here: https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo https://t.co/DAtLNjqdfI"
5315,JoeBiden,"As the sun sets around the world, Jill and I want to extend our warmest wishes to those marking the end of Ramadan. May your celebrations be filled with family and joy. #EidMubarak"
5316,JoeBiden,Today is the anniversary of China's brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Authorities tried to stop peaceful calls for political change with rifles &amp; tanks. The courage of the Tiananmen generation hasn't been silenced &amp; still inspires the fight for freedom and justice worldwide.
5317,JoeBiden,"We are in a climate emergency and we must take drastic action now to address it. So today, I’m announcing my plan for a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.

https://t.co/FbsOsyQkIo https://t.co/SBDrdiFu2C"
5318,JoeBiden,"We have a major problem with educational inequality and we need to tackle it head on. In a Biden Administration, we’ll triple Title I funding — creating a historic investment in schools serving a high proportion of children from low-income families. https://t.co/14A6BoG428"
5319,JoeBiden,"Happy birthday to the love of my life and the life of my love, @DrBiden. Jilly, I love you. https://t.co/WFwlUCuowv"
5320,JoeBiden,"I’m looking forward to traveling to New Hampshire this week to talk to voters about my plans for our country. 

RSVP to join us in Berlin or Concord today: https://t.co/VfNnVHbcqP"
5321,JoeBiden,"Thank you @HRC for having me tonight in Columbus. At a time when we’re seeing the forces of hate and intolerance push back on the progress we’ve made, your courage and grit gives me hope. I will always stand beside you as we fight for equality. https://t.co/NKh1oWWuKp"
5322,JoeBiden,"Gun violence occurs every day across America. Enough is enough.
Not every life lost makes national headlines, but it's just as painful for those left behind. This is an epidemic plaguing our communities &amp; destroying our children’s futures. We must act now. https://t.co/PYAHoAFmjQ"
5323,JoeBiden,"Pride is about standing up to the voices of injustice and discrimination and declaring that everyone has the right to live proud, open, and free. It's about love. We join the LGBTQ community in celebration and remember the fight is not over. We march on. Happy #PrideMonth"
5324,JoeBiden,11 innocent lives cut down. 11 more futures denied. When will we finally say enough is enough? It’s long past time to hold our leaders accountable. Jill and I are heartbroken that more American families are suffering tonight in Virginia Beach.
5325,JoeBiden,America’s teachers have been forced to make ends meet with too little pay and too few resources. That changes with a Biden Administration. We’ll finally support our educators with the pay and dignity they deserve. https://t.co/Rvl0MkS0XF
5326,JoeBiden,"One in five children experience mental health challenges, but too many don’t get help. My plan doubles the number of mental health professionals in schools to ensure every student gets the support they need.

Read the full plan here: https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV https://t.co/03B7c9Zza7"
5327,JoeBiden,"Every day, we’re witnessing the Trump Administration attack the hard fought progress made by the LGBTQ community. We can't go backwards.

5328,JoeBiden,"Thad Cochran was a friend and a true patriot in every sense of the word. Jill and I are sending our condolences to Thad’s family, he will be sorely missed."

5330,JoeBiden,"We’ve got to invest in every child — regardless of zip code or race or parents' income. In a Biden Administration, we’ll provide high-quality, universal pre-K for all three- and four-year-olds to ensure every kid gets a fair shot.

Read the full plan: https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV https://t.co/aKBwTe8bJO"
5331,JoeBiden,"South Carolina would be lucky to have @harrisonjaime representing them in the Senate. He has the character, intelligence, and integrity needed to serve his community well. I hope you'll #JoinJaime. https://t.co/Nal3ctZ06A"
5332,JoeBiden,Our motivated students make me believe America’s best days are still ahead. Thank you to Mayor @Mike_Rawlings and @SPARKDallas for a great afternoon. https://t.co/vqKIVQu7I4
5333,JoeBiden,"We had a great first day in Texas! Thank you to @rweingarten and @AFTunion for the discussion on how we improve our education system. It's time we increase teacher pay and ensure that no child’s future is determined by their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability. https://t.co/qnghcHg2Y9"
5334,JoeBiden,"Our plan will increase teacher pay and provide them with the support they deserve. We’ll invest in all children from birth, so that regardless of their zip code, parents’ income, race, or disability they are prepared to succeed in tomorrow’s economy."
5335,JoeBiden,"I’ve seen firsthand how hard teachers work with little support and few resources. We’ve got to do better. That’s why today, surrounded by America’s teachers, we laid out our plan for educators, students, and our future: https://t.co/d1o4WnDczV. https://t.co/6UxCx8bvjb"
5336,JoeBiden,Teachers like Ronniece are not only educating our children — they’re building the future of our country. https://t.co/Jr1Qf84sfq
5337,JoeBiden,"Every #MemorialDay, Jill and I remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service of our nation. Our troops are the heart, soul, &amp; spine of America—may we never fail to honor the memory of those who have fallen and ensure their spirit lives on in both our words and deeds."
5338,JoeBiden,"Everybody knows who Donald Trump is, we have to let them know who we are. We choose hope over fear. Truth over lies. And unity over division. https://t.co/X2eLN3xe7M"
5339,JoeBiden,"I’m running to offer our country a different path. Not back to a past that never was, but to a future that lives up to our founding ideals and fulfills our true promise as a country. If you’re with me, join our campaign today: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW"
5340,JoeBiden,"Across the country, too many families are being left behind. We’ve got to rebuild an inclusive middle class where everybody — regardless of race, gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or disability — gets a fair shot. https://t.co/KXmcK0tluD"

5343,JoeBiden,I can promise you this: I will do whatever it takes to make progress on the issues that matter most. https://t.co/Ta7066wGlB
5344,JoeBiden,I know how to make government work — not because I’ve talked or tweeted about it. But because I’ve done it. https://t.co/gHn7DJP4pO
5345,JoeBiden,"I’m proud to stand with @SEIU and workers across the country today in the #FightFor15. We must restore the dignity of work and ensure everyone’s treated with respect. That starts with raising the minimum wage to $15, strengthening our unions, and creating safe work environments. https://t.co/Df9rUJe6Ky"
5346,JoeBiden,"Over the last year, six children have tragically died in US custody at the border. It’s unacceptable. It’s not who we are. And silence is complicity. It’s on all of us to stand up and speak out. America is a nation of immigrants. We must guarantee everyone's treated with dignity."
5347,JoeBiden,"On Saturday, we officially kicked off our campaign in Philadelphia — the city that brought our nation together over 200 years ago. I’m running for president to unite our country, because when we come together and act as one America there’s nothing we can’t accomplish. https://t.co/syRNWo5c6i"
5348,JoeBiden,"In the 25 years since we passed the Violence Against Women Act, we’ve made great strides in protecting women from abuse. But the latest reauthorization is being held up by the @NRA. It’s outrageous. This shouldn’t be a partisan issue—the Senate should pass the #VAWA immediately."
5349,JoeBiden,Our politics today has become so mean and petty — it traffics in division and our president is the divider in chief. This is not who we are. https://t.co/M8geqIO5P0
5350,JoeBiden,We were born of an idea that every single person — no matter where they come from — can achieve anything if they work at it. https://t.co/uczQ2fBRM6
5351,JoeBiden,"Yesterday, Trump tried to attack me at his campaign rally by saying I abandoned Pennsylvania.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from. My family did have to leave Pennsylvania when I was 10 — we moved to Delaware where my Dad found a job that could provide for our family."
5352,JoeBiden,States across the nation are passing extreme laws that violate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. These bills are a blatant attempt to overturn Roe v Wade. It's wrong. It's pernicious. We must #StopTheBans and ensure this choice remains between a woman and her doctor. https://t.co/J4FL9nQgol
5353,JoeBiden,"Thank you to everyone who joined us in Philadelphia, attended watch parties in all 50 states and Puerto Rico, and tuned in across the nation. We're just getting started. I know if we work together, there's nothing we can't do. Sign up to join us: https://t.co/gnaFCACYrW https://t.co/EL4OSyW1NI"

5363,JoeBiden,"Our nation was founded on the principles of equality, equity, and fairness. But from day one, America has failed to live up to that promise for most of its people. 

We must do better. We can do better. #TeamJoe https://t.co/HEyxi8MGyI"
5364,JoeBiden,Simply put: we are better than this. #TeamJoe https://t.co/DKObz89vo8

5372,JoeBiden,"No one should be fired, denied a home or access to services because of who they are or who they love. But that’s not the reality for many LGBTQ Americans.

Today’s historic passage of the #EqualityAct moves us one step closer to righting this wrong — the Senate should act now."
5373,JoeBiden,At the core of our campaign is the idea that we always do better when we act as one America. If we choose unity over division there’s nothing we can’t do. Tune in tomorrow at 1 PM ET to join us as we kick off our campaign in Philadelphia: https://t.co/xk0GcSpr50 https://t.co/p7YbYtSCYG
5374,JoeBiden,Thank you to the @NVAssemblyDems &amp; @NVSenateDems for their hard work — and the people of Nevada for making this a reality. The Silver State is in good hands with these women leading the way. https://t.co/jiOThF0OOh
5375,JoeBiden,"Our campaign is built on restoring the American idea, that all men and women are created equal. That’s why we’re basing our campaign in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania -- the birthplace of this great experiment, American democracy. https://t.co/G1JPu0E5Jk"

5378,JoeBiden,"Thank you to the hundreds of people who joined us yesterday in the cold and rain in Nashua, NH. Our political system is broken, but I’m more optimistic about America’s chances today than I have ever been. If we come together and remember who we are, there’s nothing we can’t do. https://t.co/3xwB6lPnDc"
5379,JoeBiden,"Republicans in AL, FL, GA, and OH are ushering in laws that clearly violate Roe v Wade and they should be declared unconstitutional. Roe v Wade is settled law and should not be overturned. This choice should remain between a woman and her doctor."
5380,JoeBiden,Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect under the law—regardless of who they are or who they love. Now is not the time to back down. We must stand up to this Administration's intolerance and ensure America lives up to our founding ideals. https://t.co/IY0JvqzxOU
5381,JoeBiden,"We simply cannot accept that the number of uninsured Americans is growing. We need to defend the Affordable Care Act and build upon the progress we made to ensure every American has access to high quality, affordable health care. https://t.co/wznMlDr9dj"
5382,JoeBiden,"This Saturday, we’re officially launching our campaign to unite this country in Philadelphia — the city that first brought our nation together over 200 years ago. We’d love to see you there, head to https://t.co/a9SS6Ggm4Z to RSVP and learn more. https://t.co/feuLM8WnAN"
5383,JoeBiden,Every American should be encouraged to exercise their right to vote. I stand with @JeanneShaheen in opposing the voter suppression law that makes it harder for students in New Hampshire to participate in our political process. This law should be overturned. https://t.co/CCSoaeukNx
5384,JoeBiden,"Join us in Philadelphia on Saturday, May 18th, as we officially launch our campaign! Head to https://t.co/a9SS6FYKGp to RSVP today."
5385,JoeBiden,"Our campaign starts at the local level. Neighbors talking with neighbors, communities coming together—that’s how we’ll change the country. That’s why we’re organizing watch parties all across this nation to launch our campaign. Sign up to host yours today. https://t.co/AVCOrPu0oJ"
5386,JoeBiden,"New Hampshire, we’re heading to Manchester tomorrow and we’d love to see you there! Head to https://t.co/AmHGUD929H to RSVP."
5387,JoeBiden,"My mom was an incredible woman, and I miss her. She would always tell us that “courage is the greatest virtue, because without courage you cannot love with abandon.” She lived her life that way, loving us with abandon. I want to wish every mother out there a Happy Mother’s Day. https://t.co/zlpNBjY79g"

5393,JoeBiden,"It’s time we restore the great American middle class that built this country. That starts with making a $15 minimum wage the law of the land, ensuring health care is a right not a privilege, and creating a tax code that rewards work, not just wealth. https://t.co/6w9DZZoGSJ"
5394,JoeBiden,"Thanks to my friend, Mayor @EricGarcetti for the tacos yesterday in Los Angeles. I’ll be back soon and the ice cream is on me. https://t.co/6D5MrvCZzP"

5398,JoeBiden,"One year ago, this Administration began ripping apart immigrant families. Putting children in cages. As I told @Astrid_NV and other brave activists today, we can fix our broken immigration system without tossing aside our values. https://t.co/zYCz1PViOX"
5399,JoeBiden,I’m so inspired by @DrBiden for her dedication to educating future generations. Happy #TeacherAppreciationDay to all the hardworking educators out there! https://t.co/wAZ4rseqkq

Thank you to everyone who joined us, we’ll be back soon! https://t.co/jly3piXzPE"
5403,JoeBiden,"Nevada, we’re taking our campaign to Henderson tomorrow, May 7th! Head to https://t.co/zTS0WldilG to RSVP and come join us."
5404,JoeBiden,"On this first day of Ramadan, Jill and I wish peace and happiness to Muslims around the world celebrating the holy month. Ramadan Kareem."
5405,JoeBiden,"Our country may seem more divided than ever, but I know our best days are still ahead. It’s time we lift our heads up and remember who we are. If you’re ready to get to work, join our campaign today. https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS"

5411,JoeBiden,"Tough, resilient, and always full of hope — that’s the America I know and that’s the America we must restore. It’s time to dig deep, take action, and fight for the soul of this nation. Join our campaign and let’s get to work. https://t.co/lyhRyWPhvS"
5412,JoeBiden,"Since we launched our campaign last week, we’ve seen Americans in every corner of the country step up and say they’re in. Will you join us? Head to https://t.co/twQHMjvY7e and be part of our team."
5413,JoeBiden,"Last year, Floridians voted to restore voting rights to those who served their time for felonies. But today, Florida's Senate votes on a bill that would instead create a modern-day poll tax, suppressing the vote of tens of thousands of Americans. This is unacceptable."
5414,JoeBiden,"On Holocaust Remembrance Day, let us pause and reflect on the millions of Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazi regime.

The events of the last few months remind us that it’s not enough to just say never again—we must speak up and act against hate."
5415,JoeBiden,"This country wasn’t built by Wall Street bankers and CEOs and Hedge Fund Managers. It was built by you — the great American middle class. I’m thankful for all the support this week from union membership and their families, including the IAFF. https://t.co/0utHvHuUyi"
5416,JoeBiden,"Today, the House votes on #HR9, the #ClimateActionNow Act, which restores our commitment to the #ParisAgreement. We need to face facts on climate change. It’s already here. It is a major threat to our future and we simply cannot wait to take action."
5417,JoeBiden,Happy 48th Birthday to @Amtrak and the incredible men and women whose tireless work every day keeps the trains running and our country moving. https://t.co/vz9pxE84Ja
5418,JoeBiden,I’m the proud husband of a teacher and know first-hand the impact of their work. Teachers around the country and in South Carolina deserve to earn a living wage and have smaller class sizes so that America can continue to out-educate and lead the world. #AllOutMay1
5419,JoeBiden,"The violence in Venezuela today against peaceful protesters is criminal. Maduro's regime is responsible for incredible suffering. The U.S. must stand with the National Assembly &amp; Guaidó in their efforts to restore democracy through legitimate, internationally monitored elections."
5420,JoeBiden,It's no secret that I love ice cream. I enjoyed stopping by The Cone Shoppe in Monticello for some chocolate/vanilla twist soft serve and the chance to talk with some Iowans after our first campaign stop. https://t.co/jVFLBUwFp6
5421,JoeBiden,"It was great to see many of our first responders and union leaders in Cedar Rapids today. This country was built by hard working Americans like you, and I look forward to being back soon! https://t.co/qhtqdfweht"
5422,JoeBiden,"Today, The House will hold it's first hearing on the Equal Rights Amendment in 36 years. It's way past time to give all people protection under the Constitution--human rights should never be caught up in the whims of whichever political party is in power. We need the #ERANow."
5423,JoeBiden,Serving as @BarackObama's Vice President was a privilege and an honor. We share the belief that America is a place where ordinary people do extraordinary things and anything is possible. https://t.co/Y5rXEijgIu
5424,JoeBiden,"As I shared in Pittsburgh today, there are three reasons I’m running for President - to restore the soul of our nation, rebuild its backbone - the middle class, and unify all Americans. If you stand with me, join our campaign: https://t.co/twQHMjvY7e"
5425,JoeBiden,"I'm sick of this President badmouthing unions. Labor built the middle class in this country. Minimum wage, overtime pay, the 40-hour week: they exist for all of us because unions fought for those rights. We need a President who honors them and their work."
5426,JoeBiden,"I couldn't be more proud to have the International Association of Fire Fighters on my team. Unions built the middle class in this country—and as President, I'll fight to strengthen them and grow the backbone of this country. https://t.co/rsUEowyxz7"
5427,JoeBiden,"I've said it before and I'll say it again. To speak to the middle class, we need to reject the super PAC system. That's exactly what this campaign is doing. https://t.co/Jc46rdBbsh https://t.co/SeEfkmkSyx"
5428,JoeBiden,Join me in Pittsburgh tomorrow for a discussion on my plan to build a middle class where everyone comes along. RSVP to let me know you’ll be there: https://t.co/WLKs9xmHM7

Jill and I send our condolences to his wife Charlene and the entire Lugar family."
5431,JoeBiden,"Wishing everyone in the Orthodox Christian community a peaceful and joyful Easter celebration with friends, family and loved ones. God Bless."
5432,JoeBiden,"Jill and I are devastated to hear about today’s shooting at the Chabad Poway synagogue. No one should have to worship in fear.

As a country, we must speak out against bigotry and gun violence. We’re in the battle for the soul of this nation—and it’s on all of us to act."
5433,JoeBiden,I have a message for #TeamJoe: Thank you! https://t.co/j61zCaZmDz
5434,JoeBiden,I had the privilege to thank one of our grassroots donors. It's because of supporters like Josh we're able to make this campaign a reality and bring this country together. https://t.co/afNTBQb4xB

5441,JoeBiden,The core values of this nation… our standing in the world… our very democracy...everything that has made America -- America --is at stake. That’s why today I’m announcing my candidacy for President of the United States. #Joe2020 https://t.co/jzaQbyTEz3
5442,JoeBiden,"The hard working men and women of @UFCW that I met today are going without pay during this strike. If you can, pitch in to make sure that those workers facing the greatest hardship are supported. https://t.co/49JkqJG1Cu"
5443,JoeBiden,My wife Jill always reminds me that any country that out-educates us will out-compete us. Our teachers must have the resources they need &amp; the wages they deserve so that America will continue to lead the world. Great speech today on this from @rweingarten. https://t.co/aaU10GNjOB
5444,JoeBiden,"I'm on my way up to a rally at #StopandShop in Boston to stand with some of the 31,000 @UFCW union members who are currently fighting against cuts to wages and health care for themselves and their families. Stand with us: https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH"
5445,JoeBiden,"For centuries, Notre Dame Cathedral has withstood wars, revolutions, and the test of time. It is a symbol of faith &amp; a testament to history. And even as our hearts break to see it burn today during the holiest week of the year for Catholics, I have faith that it will rise again."
5446,JoeBiden,This is powerful. I would encourage everyone to read and take to heart Kyle’s message on privilege. https://t.co/Kceif5wFvg
5447,JoeBiden,"In the last 5 years, @StopandShop's parent company has bought back billions of dollars in stock. Now they want to cut employee wages &amp; benefits. This is wrong. I stand with the 31,000 @UFCW workers fighting for their healthcare. Join me and support them: https://t.co/D4baO7D5xH"
5448,JoeBiden,"Social norms are changing. I understand that, and I’ve heard what these women are saying. Politics to me has always been about making connections, but I will be more mindful about respecting personal space in the future. That’s my responsibility and I will meet it. https://t.co/Ya2mf5ODts"
5449,JoeBiden,"Stoning people to death for homosexuality or adultery is appalling and immoral. Every single person on earth is entitled to be treated with dignity and to live without fear. There is no excuse—not culture, not tradition—for this kind of hate and inhumanity. https://t.co/g208NzeS7l"
5450,JoeBiden,.@NRA opposition to a full reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act is sickening. We must do more to protect victims of stalking and abuse. It makes no sense to allow those who perpetrated the abuse to have access to deadly firearms. We must stand up now for survivors.
5451,JoeBiden,"Whether on the assembly line, at the grocery store checkout, or in the boardroom, every woman deserves to make every penny a man doing the same job makes. The #PaycheckFairnessAct will help us get there. Congratulations @rosadelauro and thank you for your leadership on this."
5452,JoeBiden,"I was honored to meet Vlad and Adrianna tonight at the #BidenCourageAwards. These young people exemplify what @ItsOnUs is all about. I hope their bravery inspires more to take action to change our culture.

5453,JoeBiden,"I’m proud of my alma mater @UDelaware &amp; the student organizers of @UDance for their commitment to fighting childhood cancer.

https://t.co/d69oDCAgzL"
5454,JoeBiden,"The people of Guatemala should be the ones to choose their next president. The stakes are high: promoting transparency, shared prosperity, and combating corruption. For this reason, the @TSEGuatemala needs to certify all eligible presidential candidates by the Sunday deadline."
5455,JoeBiden,"On behalf of Jill, myself, and all of the Bidens, our hearts go out to the community in Christchurch suffering from today’s senseless violence. Friday prayers for those who were gathered at their mosques has seen families torn apart by hate."
5456,JoeBiden,"No one should live in fear of being fired, evicted from their home, or denied service in a restaurant just because of their gender identity or who they love. The #EqualityAct is long overdue, and will ensure LGBTQ Americans are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."
5457,JoeBiden,"Joe Boardman led @Amtrak through difficult times, taking over during the worst economic crisis since the Depression, and starting a modernization that will help deliver the 21st century rail system America deserves. My thoughts are with his wife Joanne and their family."

5459,JoeBiden,Notes are ready. Be sure to tune in at 3pm ET when I will sit down at @UDBidenSchool with author and historian @jmeacham to talk about his book “The Soul of America” and the state of our democracy today. https://t.co/3F6qAEE3qA https://t.co/irisDJmDLu
5460,JoeBiden,"Foreign election interference is not only a serious threat to our democratic institutions, it’s a threat to our national security. Russia and other authoritarian regimes are actively seeking to try to change outcomes of our democratic elections, and we can’t allow that to happen. https://t.co/9hFF6sHCQ5"
5461,JoeBiden,"Today I congratulated President @IvanDuque on his successful visit to Washington. Maintaining strong bipartisan support for #Colombia is vitally important to meeting key security and economic challenges in the hemisphere, including humanitarian aid for refugees from #Venezuela."
5462,JoeBiden,"When I wrote the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, I believed it would be a lifeline. But this Congress has turned it into a political football. It’s time to pass a strong reauthorization to the Violence Against Women Act. No more stalling. Lives are on the line."
5463,JoeBiden,"One year after the tragic massacre in Parkland, we’ve not done nearly enough to ensure this will never happen again. In the last year far too many have died from gun violence. But I have hope. #MSDStrong"
5464,JoeBiden,Only a tyrant would prevent the delivery of food and medicine to people he claims to lead. The international community must support Juan Guaido and the National Assembly. It is time for Maduro to step aside and allow a democratic transition. The Venezuelan people deserve better.
5465,JoeBiden,John Dingell was the Dean of the House. He earned that title — not just because he was there the longest — but because he led with great moral courage and vision. He was a friend and I will miss him terribly. Debbie is in my prayers.
5466,JoeBiden,Stacey Abrams achieved in a matter of minutes something Donald Trump failed to do in over an hour -- to embrace and give voice to the spirit and core values that make America great.
5467,JoeBiden,"Today far too many transgender youth continue to face rejection at home and discrimination in their communities. Check out the work @bidenfoundation is doing with @lgbtmap and @genderspectrum to support these young people: https://t.co/TxMLXge8vh 
#AdvancingAcceptance"
5468,JoeBiden,"There is no place for racism in America. Governor Northam has lost all moral authority and should resign immediately, Justin Fairfax is the leader Virginia needs now."
5469,JoeBiden,"This week @bidenfoundation submitted a comment to the Department of Education about proposed changes to #TitleIX guidance.

These new rules would endanger students and make it harder for survivors of sexual assault to seek justice. https://t.co/qEV7z3Ewpx"
5470,JoeBiden,"What happened today to @JussieSmollett must never be tolerated in this country. We must stand up and demand that we no longer give this hate safe harbor; that homophobia and racism have no place on our streets or in our hearts. We are with you, Jussie. https://t.co/o8ilPu68CM"
5471,JoeBiden,"An untested rape kit means a survivor without justice. I wrote the first rape kit backlog law because every survivor deserves closure, and because evidence shows testing kits can identify men who have committed multiple rapes - and might again. Test every kit. Every single one."
5472,JoeBiden,The spirit of Dr. King is still with us. It has burrowed deep into the soul of this nation. It will not let us rest. On #MLKDay we must heed Dr. King’s admonition from his final sermon and do our part to “make America what it ought to be.”
5473,JoeBiden,"“Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex.” 

Another step forward for equality and basic dignity in Delaware tonight, as the Equal Rights Amendment is enshrined in our state’s Constitution."

5475,JoeBiden,"I know I’m a little biased, but this post from Jill @DrBiden in the #BidenForum is a must-read. Her story of the strong middle-class values that shaped her is America’s story. And she tells it so well. https://t.co/RbsmCOGRv5"
5476,JoeBiden,"I’ve had disagreements with Secretary Mattis, but we shared the view — long-held by Democrats and Republicans in this nation — that respect for our allies and a commitment to the most important and effective alliances in history made America safer."
5477,JoeBiden,"Friends don't let friends go uninsured. If you still need health insurance for 2019, tomorrow, December 15th, is the last day to get it through https://t.co/2Ls3d80By6. This is about your health and peace of mind for you and your loved ones — there's nothing more important. https://t.co/hnXCRbOiOZ"
5478,JoeBiden,"This summer, the @bidenfoundation asked you to share stories about the importance of family and community acceptance for #LGBTQ young people. Here’s what you’ve said so far: https://t.co/o3NTnmNzH1"
5479,JoeBiden,Now that’s more like it. https://t.co/w34Lo9Ods3

5482,JoeBiden,"Betsy DeVos’ new Title IX rules will discourage sexual assault reporting and investigations. When 1 in 5 women experience sexual assault while in college, we can’t afford to go backwards. Share your views: https://t.co/eSsO7c9yXD"
5483,JoeBiden,"The fires continue to burn in California, and our firefighters are among those who are losing everything. Right now, no matter where you live, you can help. Please give to support firefighters who have lost their homes to the wildfires: https://t.co/BwM7gzZAjw"
5484,JoeBiden,"Instead of saying every legal vote should be counted in Florida, Republicans have adopted a strategy to discredit the process. 

It’s wrong – and it’s dangerous. 

Count every single lawful vote. Count them fairly. Count them transparently. https://t.co/9pANgOv2dY"
5485,JoeBiden,Congratulations to @kyrstensinema for a well-earned victory tonight. She’s going to do incredible work for Arizona. Credit to @MarthaMcSally as well for handling the results with true dignity and class.
5486,JoeBiden,"Every military family knows what it means to sacrifice. Every individual life and story matters. It is who we are as Americans. 

On #VeteransDay and every day we must stand up for the men and women who put their lives on the line to defend us."
5487,JoeBiden,"It’s the most fundamental American right: the right to vote — and for your vote to be counted. Count all the votes in Florida, Georgia, and Arizona. Count them fairly. Count them transparently."
5488,JoeBiden,There's still time to take this election into your own hands. Don't regret what you could have done—take action right now: https://t.co/hPaGx4kLyA

5492,JoeBiden,"You don’t need to be a Vice President or a podcast star to to make a difference in this election. 

Volunteer now, knock on some doors, and make sure you show up to vote this Tuesday. https://t.co/ErWycs1ORg"
5493,JoeBiden,"Voting restrictions in Georgia weren’t meant to protect the sanctity of our vote, but to suppress turnout. I applaud the court rulings to overturn them and right these wrongs. 

We should be making voting easier, not harder. Now let’s prove nothing can stop us. Vote. https://t.co/utgGhoJzGQ"
5494,JoeBiden,"The character of our country is on the ballot on Tuesday, but you still have a chance to make a difference today. Don't just vote -- volunteer on #TheLastWeekend. It's that important. https://t.co/nw9I8WfFK1 https://t.co/0mvuVFh9aX"

5506,JoeBiden,"Our basic American values are under assault. But we can take this country back if we show up and vote.

5508,JoeBiden,"Joe Tydings and I were both inspired by JFK &amp; RFK and their call to service. In the Senate, he lived up to their example with an ironclad commitment to fight the abuse of power and work to ensure that every American gets a fair shot. Joe made America better—he will be missed."
5509,JoeBiden,"Jason - public service takes many forms, and bravely stepping forward today is exactly that. By sharing your story, you are saving lives. Others will get the help they need because of you.

5516,JoeBiden,"Inspiring words from @BarackObama today.  A powerful reminder that it's on all of us to vote this fall if we want leaders who reflect the civility, character, dignity, and goodness of the American people. The stakes couldn't be higher, but Americans always rise to the occasion."
5517,JoeBiden,"If there was ever a time for a change of pace, it is now. I recommend giving Michael’s new podcast a listen. https://t.co/Ju2AgDdohi"
5518,JoeBiden,Organized labor is why we have a minimum wage in this country. It’s why we have the five-day work week. It’s why we have worker safety standards. It’s why we have a middle class in America. We owe them. https://t.co/s8vdvVs4dp
5519,JoeBiden,"Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales’s decision to end CICIG’s mandate represents a serious blow to anti-corruption efforts in the hemisphere.

5527,JoeBiden,"In the time I have known him, John Brennan has never been afraid to speak up and give it to you straight. Revoking his security clearance is an act unbecoming of a President. If you think it will silence John, then you just don't know the man."
5528,JoeBiden,"Today we honor the memory of Heather Heyer, whose spirit we see in every person who stands up to reject hatred and bigotry. Make no mistake: this fight goes on. The battle for the soul of this nation rests with each of us, everyday."

5540,JoeBiden,"I said a year ago we’re living through a battle for the soul of this nation. Now there can be no doubt. Roe, Obergefell, Fisher, and more—so many of our fundamental rights, freedoms, and liberties—and the rule of law—are all at risk."
5541,JoeBiden,"Inspired by the patients, families, clinicians, and researchers of @stjuderesearch I met earlier this month. They are making hope real. Join us and let us know about your #cancerFIERCE story. https://t.co/YONYdf0tpY https://t.co/WSRAI7sBRn"
5542,JoeBiden,"We don’t need to treat migrants from Central America with cruelty to strengthen US border security.

5555,JoeBiden,"Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect, but too many LGBTQ Americans are still denied this basic right. That’s why I’m proud to announce a new inclusion initiative between @bidenfoundation and @YMCA. The work continues: https://t.co/Qi20gM6TXp"

5573,JoeBiden,My mother often reminded me that “bravery resides in every heart and some day it will be summoned.” Lt. Col. Arnaud Beltrame answered the call last Friday in France. Taking the place of a hostage and paying the ultimate price. His heroism and self-sacrifice must not be forgotten.
